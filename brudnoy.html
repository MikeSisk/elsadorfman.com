Be sure to watch the one minute movie Chuck Kramer made while I was photographing <a href="kraemerfilms.html">David Brudnoy</a>!


<p>

David Brudnoy died in the most wonderful way.  He sd goodbye to all his 
friends, he even had the last of his radio shows, like someone out of 
Beckett, the day before he died, from his hospital room.  He had decided he 
had had enuf pain and that it was time to go.  He was a great teacher and 
perhaps his greatest teaching was showing us how to die, to leave, w/ 
grace. To say goodbye and call it quits.  It was a lesson even for his 
doctors I'm sure.
</p><p>

</p><p> 

  I first met David when Allen Ginsberg was on his program in the 
seventies.  Jack Kerouac called up to quarrel w/ Allen on the air.  Allen 
didn't lose his cool and neither did Brudnoy.  Jack jack you don't get it i 
remember allen saying. I think they were arguing abt the vietnam war. then of course 
over the years many
hours sitting in david's home studio or wbz while david and harvey silverglate did a 
program together.
during the commercials was the best part.  they had such a good time 
together discussing whatever.  The 
cavalcade of Brudnoy guests is a time capsule of our period. Unfortunately, 
Brudnoy NEVER kept an archive of his programs.  It is hard to believe. 
Maybe there is someone out there w/ a secret cache of Brudnoy programs. It 
wd be great history.

</p><p>

It's hard to figure who will replace him in Boston.  He 
is  irreplaceable.  He knew everyone. He introduced people to people. He 
told people what other people were doing.  He loved making connections. And 
he never let differences of opinion stand in his way if he liked the 
person.  He just discussed, not argued, but discussed and discussed and 
discussed issues w/ that person.   He was open and friendly w/ people w/ 
whom he disagreed. He shared every aspect of his life w/ whomever he was 
w/.  He was just great on the radio. He had listeners/callers who had 
called in hundreds of times over twenty five years. He wrote a book called 
Life is not a Rehearsal, available on amazon still. In it you realize how 
much david suffered  as a gay young man at yale in the fifties and early 
sixties.  and you realize how much david changed in the forty odd years 
since yale. how different he was in his last fifteen years. different from 
the person who wrote the book. As my webguru kyle nicholls says, his complexity is compelling.

He was like the energizer bunny, teaching, reading, writing abt movies, 
always  on the go. Endlessly precocious.   Even if he was tired, and even 
when he was sick, he didn't let that keep him from going, going going. once harv silverglate and I met david in paris and 
we struggled to keep up w/ david ....he was coping w/ aids and was always a 
block ahead of us.  if we met for dinner he had seen four monuments to our 
one.
 He 
loved his students and loved being the grand uncle to them.  He wd take 
them travelling, take them to nice restaurants and introduce them to all 
kinds of people.  He was the ultimate mentor.  One of my portraits is of 
David w/ one of his students.  He took the role of teacher to these young 
men seriously.  He felt he had benefited from  relationships w/ older men 
and that it was very important for young men to have such 
relationships.  He was the perfect uncle in the way a dad cd not be 
perfect.   To get a flavor of him, be sure to watch the very short movie 
done by chuck kraemer.  One of the funniest things abt david was that when 
he went out of town, even for a short weekend, he wd tell everyone on his 
personal email lists NOT to write to him between six on friday nite and 
eight on monday morning BECAUSE all his emails wd be deleted w/o being 
read.  No exceptions. the emails automatically went into the trash bin I 
guess. Or maybe David was being mischievous and he did read emails when he 
got home from those the most insistent. But now he really is out of email 
touch.  Be sure to find the links to David on the WBZ web site,
