<p><img src="mel_in_box.jpg" width="311" height="400" align=right />
After a year in New York, I became confused by the creative life I
was observing and the conventional life I thought I should be living.
I moved back to Boston and I continued to arrange poetry readings,
but I still d idn't see how I could have a creative life myself. In
desperation, I went to Boston College and got a degree in elementary
education. I began teaching fifth grade in a public elementary school
in Concord, Ma. I read haiku and short poems by Creeley and Ginsberg
to my students. My homeroom class was never organized enough to
pledge to the flag and to read from the Bible before the bell rang.
Finally, one of the parents told me," Yo u shouln't be doing this. I
work for a place called Educational Developm ent Corporation. They
match far-out teachers with scientists to develop curriculum
materials."</p>

<p>I immediately announced to my poet friends I was a photographer.
No o ne laughed and I was on my way. Bob Creeley called to say that
he needed a photograph for his new book. Charles Olson said, "Come on
down to Glo ucester." Gordon Cairnie said he could use portraits of
poets for the wal ls of his Grolier Book Shop. Gary Snyder and Philip
Whalen went camera s hopping in Kyoto and shipped me a Mamiya C-33 in
a soft leather case.</p>

<p>I took my camera everywhere and photographed everyone and
everything. All the time. In my first apartment, (it had one room) I
painted two walls black and set up a darkroom across from my daybed.
In those days n obody knew anything about chemicals and the need for
ventilation. After n ine years, I put together a collection of
portraits of my friends in my house, <a href="../housebook/index.html">Elsa's
Housebook--A Woman's Photojournal</a>, published by David R. Godine
in 1974. But I didn't try to support myself as a photographer. I did
editing and writing jobs to pay the rent. In th e sixties, it was
still possible to live on the edge.</p>

<p><img src="Osbornes.jpg" width="311" height="400" align=left /> <br clear=right />From
the very beginning of his company, Dr. Land had given photographers
Polaroid cameras and film and had collected their work. He had close
relationships with Ansel Adams, Paul Caponigro, Philippe Halsmann and
Ma rie Cosindas and believed that his company would benefit from his
commitm ent to artists. Eventually, his support was formalized into
the Polaroid Artists Support Program which encouraged selected
photographers to use P olaroid materials in exchange for prints for
the Polaroid Collection. Hav ing seen work made on the 20x24, I was
dying to use the camera. Bob Roden at Polaroid agreed to subsidize a
session on February 7, 1980 when Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky
came to Boston to read their poetry and were staying with me.</p>

<p>I was supposed to make a temperate ten or twelve images. We did
several nudes while Bob, Roger Gregoire and Peter Bass, who ran the
camera that day, shook their heads and wondered what was going to
happen next. I ha d always worked with small format cameras and
didn't realize large camera s should be treated thoughtfully as the
ponderous instruments they are. I snapped away as if I were using
35mm film. No wonder they were aghast. By the time I called it quits
I had made 30 images. The amaryllis we had brought to the studio went
from tight shut to full bloom under the studi o lights. I was
hooked.</p>

<p>I wanted to photograph my husband Harvey Silverglate and our son
Isaac\ and my other friends on the 20x24. How could I get more time
on the camera? Subsidy by Polaroid was out of the question because
the Artist Suppor t Program was besieged with requests. Renting the
camera was costly. I thought about taking commissioned portraits on
the 20x24 to cover the sub stantial rental cost but dismissed the
idea as too scary. How would I fin d people to hire me? How could I
take good portraits of people I didn't know? I had been a
photographer for eighteen years, photographing peop le I knew.
Finally, encouraged by Harvey who kept on asking "what's the worst
that could happen?" I decided to go for it.</p>
