<p><b>Aldo:</b> Randy, that is exactly what I think of when I see us five together. 
  We were all in a class that was taught by a guy named Randy. He was a great 
  teacher, and I think every student felt like he was their friend. And he was 
  really a big guy, so we all looked at him in awe. Here was this big, strong, 
  cool guy, who was our teacher.
