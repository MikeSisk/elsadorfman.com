<b>Aldo:</b> The condom shot. No, actually this picture was for an AIDS awareness photo, if I'm not mistaken.  But I think for us, it was the condom shot. To be a teenager, and have your picture taken with condoms, a kinda strange but cool feeling.  Like, "look at us we're young, but we must be cool, cause we're holding condoms."
