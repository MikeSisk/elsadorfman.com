<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<b>Aldo:</b> The four of us spent at least four years together, always in the same class.  Eliahu's father Abraham was our soccer coach.  Since I was a great friend of his, along with Eugene, we always spent time at his house.  We'd actually spend the week talking about our games, who was good, who was not, but basically about the greatness of  our team.
