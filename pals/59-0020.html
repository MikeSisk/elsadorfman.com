<p><b>Aldo:</b> You know in this picture, I'm a bit taller than Isaac, but for 
  the next maybe seven years, we would go back and forth. He's a little taller, 
  then I'm a little taller, and so forth. I think this was the age when Isaac 
  and I began to become friends. We both had other, closer friends, but we began 
  to hang out more and more.
</p><p><b>Eugene:</b> Isaac And Aldo (Probably 1988) -- Aldo looks mighty cool with his shorts on the outside of his pants.  And yes, good old CYS (Cambridge Youth Soccer), I started playing with Aldo, Zephyr and Eliahu Susman to do something after school at Hoyt Field and everyone else was doing it (except Isaac), so I figured what the heck.  I began to love it and we had a championship team.  I met and had many friends on Abraham's team over the years and went on to play soccer at Commonwealth, I got pretty good at it and started every game in high school since my freshman year.
</p><p><b>Isaac:</b> A few interesting things going on in this picture.  First of all, Aldo's wearing a soccer shirt and I'm not wearing glasses.  These two facts may seem unrelated and unimportant, but I now believe that they had a major effect on my relationship with Aldo:  At this age, Aldo was all about sports.  He played basketball and soccer all the time with his friends.  I never played sports.  Why?  BECAUSE I COULDN'T SEE!  Or maybe I just wasn't athletic.  At any rate, my not playing sports put a real distance between us.  That's why I'm surprised that we look so chummy in this photo.  Go figure.  Eventually, Aldo and I became the closest of friends.  One other thing, notice that Aldo's wearing shorts over his pants.  You really have to wonder about that.
