<p><b>Eugene:</b> "Carrying Lucas" -- Lucas Hughes was 6'5" while we were in elementary school.  He was a man's size well before his time.  I'm not sure why we decided to carry him, but it made for an interesting effect.  I'm wearing an African medallion, I remember I borrowed it from Hakim Rashad (Born Wise).  I looked up to him at that time, because he was knowledgable about African American history and Afrocentric concepts.  That was seventh grade.  Football & Fummycon (sp?) (Aldo's first videogame system from Japan)
</p><p><b>Isaac:</b> Lucas was a frikin' giant.  I don't know who thought of this pose, but I bet it was Lucas.  Great idea.  I love this one.
</p><p><b>Aldo:</b> I can't help but be affected by what Isaac wrote. It is really true; Lucas was very big for his age.  Even when kids seesaw in height, Lucas never did.  He was always the tallest of the group.  I wonder if that does anything to a kid's psyche.  I mean, he was always the leader of any group adventure -- brave, for sure.  Maybe because he was always used to being viewed as the oldest?
