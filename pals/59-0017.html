<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<b>Aldo:</b> I've known Jabula my whole life.  His mom is like my second mother, so it almost feels like we're brothers or something.  He was at the age in this picture when he wanted to hang out with the older kids, but we felt we were too old, pretty strange.
<p><b>Eugene:</b> This is a picture of Jabula and Aldo.  Aldo and Lucas used to put him in a pillowcase and beat him.  He was so tuff.  He also was a very good swimmer.
