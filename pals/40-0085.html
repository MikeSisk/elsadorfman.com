<p><b>Aldo:</b> Getting pictures taken was always fun. By thirteen we all had 
  a lot of experience in front of the camera. It's hard to remember what was going 
  on in my life at this point. I was thirteen, ten years younger than I am today. 
  I certainly feel like a different person, and I look like a different person. 
  But all my friends still look the same to me, just smaller versions of themselves 
  now, so maybe that's true for me too.
