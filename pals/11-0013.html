<p><b>Aldo:</b> This was a very exciting picture for us because we were doing 
  some charity work that displayed on trains all over Boston. I was excited because 
  I felt like I would be a minor, minor celebrity. Hey, the train station, it's 
  a start, right. Also, since we were holding up condoms, we thought it was also 
  a cool thing to be seen doing.
</p><p><b>Eugene:</b> "Condom Dispensers" -- Elsa asked us to take part in the "40 Ways to Fight Aids" Campaign.  We volunteered to pose as "Condom Dispensers."  I remember being a little bit uncomfortable about holding the condoms.  But we tried to look smooth, nonetheless.  I also remember feeling excited about seeing myself on the ad campaigns on the Orange Line of the MBTA.
</p><p><b>Isaac:</b> I was in a poster on the subway once.  Were you?  Didn't think so.
