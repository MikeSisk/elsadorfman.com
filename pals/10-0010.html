<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<b>Aldo:</b> It's always an experience to meet your friend's girlfriends.  Someone who knows your friend really well, but in a totally different way than you.  I only met a few of Isaac's girlfriends while he was at Columbia, and Sonja was one of them.  She seemed really nice, and even prepared a dinner for all of Isaac's close buddies. But Isaac never told me how it ended -- I took that as my cue to not ask.
