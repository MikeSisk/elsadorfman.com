<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<b>Aldo:</b> This is really funny.  First Eugene looking like a poor man's R&B lead man.  And then there's me, who's laughing but like I'm alone laughing, with my eyes shut. Isaac with this uncharacteristic, huge grin on his face, is once in a lifetime, believe me.  And then Casey, who is usually bright-eyed, has eyes looking all but closed.  This must have been when we were doing our pre-picture humor routine.  Only this time it was caught on camera.
