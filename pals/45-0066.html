<b>Eugene:</b> This is me.  I am wearing a Africocentric medallion.  I think I got it from Born Wise, formerly Hakim Rashaad.  I really looked up to him, since he had knowledge of Black history.  He was in 8th when I was in 7th.  I remember really clearly his Red Yum Yums.  My flattop was really high.
