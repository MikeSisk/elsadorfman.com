<p><b>Aldo:</b> I was seven years old when this picture was taken. This is the 
  earliest time in my life I have memories. I'm on the far right, and the kid 
  standing to my left is Lucas Hughes, he was my best friend. I even remember 
  the shirt I was wearing because it was warm, and me and Lucas were always out 
  riding bikes or trying to go wherever we could.</p>
<p><b>Isaac:</b> I wonder why everyone has arms around each other except for me.  That's kind of sad.  What a bunch of jerks.
