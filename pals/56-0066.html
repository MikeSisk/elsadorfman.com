<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<b>Aldo:</b> 1995 was a good time for us as friends.  It was right before we went to school, and we had been spending a lot of time with each other.  So it was a really important time for us as friends, we knew that we had to get involved in that thing that everyone always was making such a big deal about ... life. It was now our turn to get out beyond the grasp of our parents and start making serious life decisions on our own. Quite a time, wouldn't want to do it again.
