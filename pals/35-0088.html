<p><b>Eugene:</b> "Issac's Dinasour Shirt" - May 13, 1986( I was 9)<br />
If you look closely you'll know that this is an old picture because the
seamless doesn't cover the floor.  I remember Eric, between Isaac and I was
Rafi's best friend and I used to be jealous of him.  But then he moved back
to France(ha, ha!).  Noah was always strange but I liked him, a real free
spirit.  My mother used to always say that "Rafi looked like something out of
a Norman Rockwell painting."  Man my sneakers were hurting bad.   I have to
give the Dorfmans credit for making velcro sneaker the in thing to do:)
</p><p><b>Isaac:</b> Before "Jurassic Park," I had a fine appreciation for prehistoric reptiles.  Rafi was always my idol when it came to humor (note the bow-tie).  I was never close to Noah and Eric; what can you do.  Eugene sure was a skinny little thing.

<b>Aldo:</b> This picture I actually remember the day, which is pretty strange for me.  I have very few detailed, drawn out memories before 7 or 8.  Just quick flashes of events.  This is one of them, because of  Rafi's "dollar tie."  I remember watching Rafi put on the tie, it seemed so neat, and I remember wishing I had something neat to show people that I made.</p><p>
