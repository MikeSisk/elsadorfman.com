<b>Aldo:</b> So, this was basically the filming crew.  Eugene and I were stand-ins at best.  But we really wanted to be part of this filming crew, and eventually, I worked myself into the role of the faceless, nameless guy who gets beaten and killed in every scene … ahhh … the sweet swell of victory.  Let that be a lesson, kids -- hard work is often rewarded, as long as you weren't working to gain self-esteem.
