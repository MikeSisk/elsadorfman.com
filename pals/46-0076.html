<b>Aldo:</b> Right about this time Isaac got a haircut, and started working out, so any picture a year later, he probably looks really different.  You'll notice Isaac is wearing a Champion shirt.  Isaac always was hip to the fashion, as I've mentioned before, and he always had cool sportswear.  Actually I'm not too fond of this shirt, but he had the right idea with Champion apparel.
