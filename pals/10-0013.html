<b>Casey:</b> I remember this picture because it was my first solo picture. This is probably the smoothest I've ever looked in an Elsa picture. I really liked that hat and I thought it went well with my outfit. This picture was was part of a set of two -- the other one was a much smoother one and in this one I just relaxed and let loose.
<p><b>Aldo:</b> Casey is stylin in this picture.  I'm not sure when this picture was taken, but it looks like about a few years old.  At this time, Casey was finishing up his studies at Columbia.  Now he is a very good teacher at a school in Boston. And he lives right around the corner from me.
