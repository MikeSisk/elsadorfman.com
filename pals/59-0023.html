<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<b>Aldo:</b> We were thirteen in this picture, and this was a good time. It was right before high school so our workload was good. We had so much free time to watch movies.  The world still felt like something we were not a part of yet. It was all just talk, as far as I knew. My biggest concerns were money for chips, and enough people to get a football game. No bills, no relationships, no numbers and figures, just friends and school.
