<p><b>Aldo: </b>I always liked this picture of Isaac because of the expression 
  that he has on his face. I did not hang out with Isaac until years later, but 
  we went to the same elementary school. I always thought he looked so needy in 
  this picture, which reminds me how young he was.
</p><p><b>Eugene:</b> Isaac's First Picture -- Isaac looks very cute and innocent.  That was probably the last time that he was innocent.  I used to have to tie Isaac's shoes for him, because it took him a while to learn.  I don't remember much about Isaac at this age except that we both think we remember meeting in the sandbox in kindergarden. When Isaac was in a little older like 2nd or 3rd grade he used to have the best toys -- two that come to rememberance are the Slay/Bike that we used to take to Tufts with Elsa, the Nixon Mask, and the Knight Armor (Ben Nugent used to be a great artist and he was also nervous, he would always rub his thighs).
</p><p><b>Isaac:</b> I want this one to be on display at my funeral.  I know people will start bawling when they see it on my casket.  I can't believe how adorable I was.  I really have no memory of this time.  That's a shame.  I bet I heard "Oooohhh, you are soooo cute!" twenty times a day.  That must have been great!
