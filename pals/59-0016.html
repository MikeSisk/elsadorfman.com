<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>
<p><b><a href="index.html">elsadorfman.com/pals</a></b></p><hr />
<b>Aldo:</b> Rafi's mom worked at this real cool store.  They sold all types of leather stuff.  It was cool as a kid, cause they sold some sexual stuff.  And as kid there was nothing I knew less about.  Rafi and I became good friends for a while, but when high school started, he moved away, and no one has heard much from him since then.
<p><b>Eugene:</b> Rafi's family:  Liza, wow, she was a very big part of my childhood.  I spent a great amount of my time at Rafi's house on Mass. Ave.  I remember she had a loft for a bed, and a computer room with a modem that took like five minutes to plug in.  I remember when Rafi's brother used to be a techie -- before there were IT professionals.
