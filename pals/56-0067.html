<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<b>Aldo:</b> These are most of the people I hung out with in high school.  This picture seems like yesterday to me, and so does hanging out with these guys.  But it's not. Two of them, Luis and Taha, are married and fell off the earth.  And everyone else is working to save and pay bills.  In high school it was common to have this many friends together when hanging out. Now it would take a death of one of us to bring us all together again.
