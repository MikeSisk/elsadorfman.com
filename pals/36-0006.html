<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<b>Aldo:</b> Compared to the other shot on this day, this looks like the deflated version.  We all look like we were posing really hard, and we just stopped and took a breath. All the energy was just dropped in a split second.  But only really recognizable when seen next to the other, same day, same clothes shot.
<p><b>Casey:</b> This picture is definitely symbolic. I can't believe how fat I was. Also it is a testament to my proudest achievements: my friends and my record. I was so happy to have a record out, it was always my dream to put out a record. Even though this record didn't do as well as I would have liked it to. Without it, I would have never put out my second record which did well, I was even more proud of and the others I will put out. Even if no one ever buys another one of my records this picture will always remind me how I had the heart to chase my dreams.
