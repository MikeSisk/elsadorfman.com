<b>Isaac:</b> You'll never see a picture of Zephyr and me by ourselves.  We never hung out together.  He was all about sports (and very good) and I wasn't.  However, in school, all our friends were in another class, so we bonded (that might have been a year or two after or before this photo.  I'm not too good at dating these things).  At any rate, it's too bad we never took one together.  I consider him a very dear friend and a great guy.  Also in this picture, Rafi was experimenting with time-travel.  He'd just come back from the 50's and didn't have time to change clothes. 
<p><b>Aldo:</b> Zephyr and Isaac for some reason always ended up in the same class.  The other eight or so friends were always together.  So these two have a unique friendship. While they never hung out exclusively, they got to know each other really well.  I remember they used to make fun of each other all the time. And they both liked the same girl; I don't know if they'll fess up to it, but it's true.
