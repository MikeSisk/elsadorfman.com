<b>Aldo:</b> This picture is one of my favorites, and I have a big copy at my house.  This picture to me looks like we were doing a magazine shoot.  Different facial expressions, but still, the picture seems to work quite nicely.  The record Casey is holding is his own, so it was also important from a group standpoint to show off Casey's hard work.  His record -- alright Casey.
