<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<b>Eugene:</b> Me & Tasha:
T- What can I say about my sister.  She was tall at an early age and very beautiful.  T and I are very alike, and very close.  She protected me as a young boy, and taught me countless things as a grew up.  She has always been there when I needed her.  All of my family (Tasha and I and my mother are all very similar).  Schneebergs in the house, represent, WHAT!!!  I've never taken a picture with my mother at Elsa's but I anticipate doing so soon.  My mother and sister are very similar although they won't admit it.  But like mother like daughter, monkey see, monkey do.  I have the best family in the world.  
Which segues into something else.  My father -- although I never met my father Charles Graham -- I have a father.  In fact, several.  A village raised me and raised me WELL.  So here is a shout out to all of my fathers/positive role models.  Harvey, Oscar, Pastor Collins, Abraham, David, Boris, Martin L. King, Malcolm X, Myles Munroe, Tyreek, and most of all (JESUS/GOD/Holy Spirit)!

<p><b>Aldo:</b> Eugene, just like me, has an older sister about six years older.  And like me, he learned a lot about what he knows from his older sister. I've known his sister for a long time also, and she's really cool, even though she probably owes Eugene a couple thousand in babysitting bills.  But she was cool to hang out as young teenagers; she always gave us good advice about life.
