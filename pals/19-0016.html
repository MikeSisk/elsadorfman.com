<b>Aldo:</b> What a group this is.  If this picture isn't screaming, "Benetton ad," I don't know what is.  This like the Earlham-Boston-Cambridge crew all in one shot.  It must have been almost four years ago that this picture was taken, but we all pretty much look the same.  You hit your peak, then it's all downhill.
