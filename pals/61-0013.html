<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<b>Aldo:</b> Who would have imagined that these kids would grow up to be responsible members of society? Not me, I wouldn't have even guessed that they'd grow up handsome, but as it now appears I've been a remarkably poor judge about the way things will be. But since it did work out well for all of them, I'm glad to be their friends, and like to believe I had a small role in some of their development -- they sure did on mine.  But Rafi, I honestly don't know much about. Maybe lucky for him; these other three hear from me all the time about the mundane details of my life.  And they listen … what friends.
