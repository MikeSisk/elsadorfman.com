<b>Aldo:</b> I just noticed that Isaac was taller than me here.  It really went back and forth for so many years. These days, Isaac always jokes about his shortness in relation to me or Eugene.  However, he's really wrong.  He's average height, if anything, a bit above it. Send him to East Asia or Central America, he'd be a giant.
