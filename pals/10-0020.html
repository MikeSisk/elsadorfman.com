<b>Eugene:</b> Isaac and women.... ha..ha...ha...ha...  He was a relatively late bloomer,
but once he did, he really fertilized and pollenated..  E**, S*****,O****,
S*****, the list goes on and on....and on.... whoever is lucky enough to
snare the ever so evasive and charming 007 will be one lucky (& busy woman,
whom I pitty).  Whatout HOTLANTA..the IVY LEAGUE Baskin Robbins lover is
coming to your town... Isaac is like a Buff Jewish Austin Powers...The
international lover man of mystery....LOL.... Isaac don't let me come down
to Atlanta to suprise you and catch you up in 112 with all the honeys.
<p><b>Aldo:</b> I could better say something if I knew what exactly Isaac was trying to do this in picture. If it is to look cool, I have no comment.  Just kidding.  Isaac had some nice dressup clothes also, something I'm still trying to get my hands on.
