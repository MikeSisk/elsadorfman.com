<b>Aldo:</b> I'll give you three guesses who the two friends who love basketball are … and the first two don't count.  Well, Isaac and I always knew basketball was not our thing, and having tall friends saved us the humiliation of proving that ourselves.  So, we decided that having a sense of humor was our thing, and still to this day, we love to watch movies, people, and situations, and as Seinfeld said, "make shallow, fairly obvious comments about life."
