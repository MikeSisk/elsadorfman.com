<b>Aldo:</b> I don't even know all of these people's names, but I think that they're mostly friends of Rafi's.  They're all from Cambridge, so I've seen them around.  It's nice to live in a city where you recognize most people.  But it isn't cool when nine out of ten times you have to make coffee table talk.  Nothing is worse than that. Well, maybe I overshot a bit, there's worse.
