<b>Aldo:</b> Well, I guess I should have listened to Isaac years ago when he said I looked better with long hair.  My sister always told me this too.  Looking at this picture with Isaac, I now realize he's right.  Although I still prefer short hair -- maintenance reasons -- he was right, I get more compliments with long hair. And who doesn't need a compliment.
