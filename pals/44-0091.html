<b>Aldo:</b> I guess the way we are dressed is what is most amazing to me. Certainly we were not projecting any future trends or following any present ones, so it says a lot about the times. Fashion for kids is still amazing to me, that parents would waste so much money on clothes there kids don't even need, and set the standard for the future for their kids. Our parents  were clever enough to avoid this.  Or as Isaac and I have rumored, had no fashion sense whatsoever.
