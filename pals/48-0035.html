<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<p><b>Aldo:</b> For sure this must have been the "hey, we're boys, look at us" picture.  It looks so funny to me now, but I'm sure when it was taken, I was trying very hard to look as cool as possible. This picture has many groups of friends who mingled with each other, but usually formed groups of two, or maybe three, to hang out with.
