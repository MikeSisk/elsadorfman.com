<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<b>Aldo:</b> Isaac was really jazzed when he met Steven Tyler. I suppose I would have been jazzed also to meet anyone famous.  But I never have, I don't even know what it means to be jazzed. I just like to say jazzed … jazzed, jazzed, jazzed.   All right, no more of that personal Insecurity slipping out.  Isaac was not a big rock fan, so I suppose this picture was much more memorable at the time for Rafi.  Rafi was always into rock n' roll.  Isaac - well, he's a swing … music … chooser, if you know what I mean.
<p><b>Eugene:</b> Rafi and Isaac with Steven Tyler from Aerosmith.  That's when Isaac and Rafi first made the jump to rock n' roll music.  I never got down with that.  But gotta give them props -- Aerosmith are big dogs.  I think Rafi knew Steven because he was from Marshfield, MA where Rafi's grandmother was from.
