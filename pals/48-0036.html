<p><b>Aldo:</b> "The basketball players" is what this picture can fairly be named.  These four guys loved to play basketball, and many of them continued to play as they got older.  All of them played high school ball; Zephyr and Frank were teammates and Eugene played for a different high school team.  And both Zephyr and Frank played college ball, as Eugene began to focus more on academics.
