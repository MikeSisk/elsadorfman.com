<p><b>Eugene:</b> "Being 13" - Actually I was 12, cause I'm a year younger than Aldo, Isaac and Rafi.  I'm not sure why I am in the shopping cart, but I always(and still do) like to be the center of attention.  Judging from the Adidas jacket I have on, that is when I first starting hanging out with Malcolm & Bernard in Roxbury.
</p><p><b>Aldo:</b> I remember this picture well, because Isaac's cousin Mathew was 
  in it. And at the time he seemed like a really old person. And as we were walking 
  to the studio, he took a tennis ball that I was playing with, and threw it across 
  the street, and I lost it cause we were in a hurry. I remember being pretty 
  angry about that.

</p><p><b>Isaac:</b> This one's a little confusing.  There are a lot of elements thrown together.  My cousin Matt's in there for no reason (don't get me wrong, I love him to death, but he's sort of just tossed in).  Also, I don't know where the shopping carts came from.  And why are we holding out three fingers?  Huh.  We should probably just move on.
