<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<b>Aldo:</b> Alice is my older sister.  She is 6 1/2 years older than me, so in many ways, she seems like a parent also.  She always helps me out, is supportive of me, and I'm always asking favors of her. But these days as I get older we have more like brother-sister talks.  I got to learn so much from watching her do things, I still had many years to think about.
