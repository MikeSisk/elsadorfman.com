<p>Aldo: This must be the time when me and Eugene started hanging out together, 
  all the time. About eighth grade, that was the time. All of our life revolved 
  around playing touch football and other sports. This was the age, when we more 
  than our parents, took the initiative to get haircuts, buy new clothes. I guess 
  this age was quite a turning point for us. We were now teenagers, and we began 
  to be concerned with all new things.
