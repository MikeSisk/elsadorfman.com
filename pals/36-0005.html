<b>Aldo:</b> At this stage we were all in college.  I was meeting all sorts of new characters from the Midwest. Eugene was suffering moral defeat at the hands of his  friends/frat brothers, who always kept him on his toes.  And Isaac, well, he was Mr. NY, and working hard at Columbia.  We did not see much of each other; however, even today it never feels like we miss a beat when we finally catch up with each other.
