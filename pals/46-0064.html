<h2>Pals: Boys Who Grew Up Together</h2>

<b>Aldo:</b> Cambridge is such a small city that if you live there as a child, you pretty much know everyone.  I never hung out with Michael too much, but he lived down the street from me. That's the way our city is; it just keeps on getting smaller, and you seem to see more and more people that you knew as a kid.
<p><b>Eugene:</b> Michael Nichols-Dunn, Rafi and Isaac.  I used to look up to Michael a lot as well.  Although he used to pick on me I still admired him.  He was tuff and cool.  I tried to be down with him.  I saw him recently at my church; he just had a little one, Mike, Jr.  I'm happy that things are coming around for him and his family.
