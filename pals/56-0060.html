<b>Aldo:</b> These are two of Eugene's lifelong friends from Boston -- both of whom I know pretty well.  Carlos, he's a really happy guy; no matter what we end up doing, he's cool. And Malcolm, I guess you could say he's one of the most sincere people you'll meet. I always have fun when I go out with these guys.
