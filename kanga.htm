<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0295972289/elsadorfmanphoto">Consuelo
Kanaga:</a> An American Photographer by Barbara Head Millstein and Sarah
M. Lowe is published by the Brooklyn Museum in association with the University
of Washington Press. 1992.224 pp., 180 images.</h3>
This book was published on the occasion of the retrospective exhibit, Consuelo
Kanaga: An American Photographer at the Brooklyn Museum in 1992, fourteen
years after her death. (In 1976, the Museum had organized a 50-print exhbit
of Kanaga's work which led Kanaga's husband to bequeth all the photographer's
negatives and a substantial number of her prints to the Museum. Thus this
study of her sixty-year career.)

<p>In alternate sections written by Barbara Head Millstein, Associate Curator
of Painting and Sculpture at The Brooklyn Museum,and Sarah M. Lowe, guest
curator, the catalogue divides Kanaga's work into seven categories and
provides a very useful biographical review of her life. Though Millstein's
essay is only 34 pages, it gives a good sense of what Kanaga was like and
how she worked. It is a little descreet about her habits (did she drink
too much to get much work done? ) about her long-term relationship (1922-1925)
and about her marriages (three). It fails to wrestle with the hard question:
why did a woman who was obviously talented and charismatic and for whom
there was no lack of opportunity turn out so little work? The text barely
mentions her work as a painter and we have no idea if painting distracted
Kanaga from photography. Nonetheless Millstein's biographical essay and
the chronology prepared by Sarah M. Lowe are indispensable. This is the
first and probably only study that will be devoted to Consuelo Kanaga's
work, though it suggests that her work deserves to be considered in any
study of how African Americans have been presented in American photography
and in any study of photography in women's magazines in the first half
of the twentieth century.

</p><p>Consuelo Kanaga was born in 1884 and grew up around San Francisco. She
worked from 1915-1922 first for the The San Francisco Chronicle and then
for the San Francisco Daily News. It was highly unusual for a woman to
be a newspaper photographer in those days and she was treated with deference
and respect by her contemporaries: Edward Weston, Dorothea Lange and Imogene
Cunningham because of her job. (Millstein and Lowe don't recap the history
of women photographers in the newspaper business so I don't know if Kanaga
has claims to being the first.) In 1918 she joined the California Camera
Club, discovered Alfred Steiglitz's &macr;<b>Camera Work</b> and decided
to become an art photographer. "It changed my life," she said. She felt
that the prints were "the most beautiful things that had ever been done
in photography, and I wanted to start from there." p. 21. That decision
to turn from what a decade later became photojournalism as we now know
it was crucial and in a way imprisoned her. It determined how and what
Kanaga photographed, how she thought about money, and how she arbitrarily
divided her life into "work for money" and "work for herself/that is ART."
It made the life of the artist incredibly romantic and devalued the life
of the self-supporting photographer. It tied her to the Steiglitz and later
Steichen aesthetic.

</p><p>From 1922-1924 Kanaga worked at The New York American, then operated
a portrait studio in San Francisco until 1927. After almost a year in Europe,
she came back first to New York and then to San Francisco married to a
man who was jealous of her work and who eventually cheated her friends
and left her with a pile of his bills to pay. She ran her portrait studio
in San Franciso from 1930 to 1935. Her work was widely respected and was
accepted into what turned out to be historic photography shows:<i>Showing
of Hands</i> and the first exhibit of Group f/64 both at the M.H. deYoung
Memorial Museum. She left San Francisco for New York in the fall of 1935
for a change of scene and to get over that distastrous marriage. In Manhattan
she worked for the WPA, photographed for the political left, got involved
with the New York Photo League, and married an artist, Wallace B. Putnam.
She freelanced for <i>Woman's Day</i>&macr; and &macr;<i>Good Housekeeping</i>&macr;,
travelled, and maintained her portrait business. In 1948 her work was included
in three important shows at the Museum of Modern Art. Just two years later
Putnam convinced her to move out of Manhattan to their modest country property
in Yorktown Heights near Croton on Hudson and in 1955 a photograph she
made five years earlier was included in Steichen's landmark museum show,
<i>The Family of Man.</i>

</p><p>Lowe and Millstein don't discuss the ramifications of the move out of
Manhattan beyond stating that Kanaga resisted Putnam for as long as she
could. The move took her away from the city which was the source of her
favorite images and took her away from her colleagues. Up to 1950 the momentum
of her career seems typical of the few successful female photographers
in Manhattan.

</p><p>Lowe and Millstein don't call attention to the fact that only three
images in their catalogue were made after 1950--although Kanaga lived until
1978. They explain simply: "She had no gift for self promotion. Few people
saw her work, and the consequence is the story of her career."p.50 and
"Perhaps her activity on both coasts contributed to her lack of public
recognition or acceptance in photographic history, although it also extended
her illustrious circle of friends, colleagues and admirers.:p.9 They write
without drawing any conclusions: p.48 "Putnam came first to her, as friends
and acquaintances have noted: She felt that her work wasn't important.
His work was important." And similarly, they relate the experience of Helen
Gee, an important figure in American photography in Manhattan p.48,49 I
wanted to show Consuelo's work in the late 1950s at the Limelight. I arranged
with a friend to drive me up to her house...As soon as we got there, she
insisted that we eat and aferwards I asked to see her photographs. She
proceeded to wander around the house looking for them in an aimless fashion.
She couldn't seem to focus at all. She couldn't find the photographs. The
conclusion was that Wally began to show us his canvases of two birds...There
must have been two hundred canvases...So, she never had a show. I didn't
see one photograph and it didn't seem to bother her at all."

</p><p>But William Maxwell who was her country neighbor got it right in his
introduction to this catalogue, "Connie herself was dispossessed--that
is to say, she was in the wrong place. The people she wanted to be photographing
were in the city, in black neighborhoods, or in the deep South." p.15.

</p><p>Millstein and Lowe are circumspect about how much Putnam contributed
financially to the marriage once he left his day job in Manhattan for Yorktown
Heights. They describe Kanaga having to live very frugally. Into the nineteen
sixties she was charging only $10 for a portrait when young people like
myself were charging $40. Her main source of income was her portrait business.
We don't know if she ever applied for a Guggenheim, an NEA grant or a grant
from the New York State Council. (We do know she never got any grants.)
Ironically, Kanaga had one treasure. In 1925 she had bought a set of Steiglitz's
&macr;<b>Camera Work</b> for $200. The authors describe her showing it
to two young collectors before she died in 1978 (when it was worth a fortune).
They do not say if Kanaga sold it to the young men and if she did, for
how much.

</p><p>Kanaga's life work included 2500 negatives and 375 prints. We do not
know if the 2500 negatives included the negatives from the sixty years
of making commercial portraits. In fact, although the catalogue is divided
into seven sections, there is no section devoted to Kanaga's commercial
portraiture or to her newspaper and magazine journalism. Nor is there anything
from the WPA project she worked on.

</p><p>Though clearly Kanaga could make a wonderful landscapes, interiors,
still lifes, and cityscapes (the potential was there to be a great photographer
with a definitive oeuvre) the portraiture chapter by Millstein is the heart
of the book. Kanaga describes her approach:p.32.".I would sacrifice resemblance
any day to get the inner feeling of a person,she later wrote. It seems
so much more of one than our face which is so often just a mask." She is
also quoted, p. 17. The great alchemy is your attitude, who you are, what
you are. When you make a photograph, it is very much a picture of your
own self. That is the important thing. Most people try to be striking to
catch the eye. I think the thing is not to catch the eye but the spirit.
"For this reason perhaps Kanaga was particulary successful photographing
children. Millstein notes that the children in all of Kanaga's portraits
of children are solemn and unsmiling. The portraits of March Avery and
of an unnamed child (figure 67) are wonderful examples of portraits that
do not try to make kids cute.

</p><p>The portraits of Barbara Deming, possibly made in 1966,and of Mark Rothko
are particularly memorable. There is one undated wonderful self-portrait
(fig.48) of Kanaga in her kitchen leaning behind a wooden chair. The chemical
stains on the image actually enhance it. Her last noncommercial portrait
of W.Eugene Smith and his wife Aileen, made in 1974, four years before
her death is warm and lively, making Smith look angelic and Aileen blissful.
A portrait of Countee Cullen (fig. 50) is forceful and thankfully departs
from her occasional formulaic portraits that manage to include the hands
cradling the face in some way. Langston Hughes is draped on a couch, staring
with a penetrating gaze at her camera. (But where is Jean Toomer who was
her close personal friend?) There is a wonderful portrait of a woman (M.C)
that is perhaps of M.C. Richards (plate 41). Figure 59 of Seddie Anderson
shows Kanaga's interest in skin texture and profile. Plate 85 of a young
African American mother with her baby girl is exhuberant and clear. The
woman seems real, not monumental or sculptural or symbolic of endurance.
These portraits by Kanaga are as wonderful as any portraits to be found
from any era. Her subjects sensed her spirit and returned the favor. William
Maxwell writes, p.15: Many years after she had focused her camera on them,
she continued to love the people she had photographed...p.15. . Even though
there are many powerful images in this book, Kanaga's photography is eclipsed
by the questions her working life raises. Found among her papers was the
following prose written by Consuelo Kanaga toward the end of her life:
p. 50

</p><p>Am I a poor taker?
<br />Why? What do I want?
<br />Am I concealing my needs and yearnings?
<br />Why should I insist on being second and carry resentments for years?
<br />Why really have I not driven the car? Is it to shackle myself and suffer
more?
<br />Why do I look down on money as an evil and yet be in need of enough
to live on?
<br />Was it necessary to divide my creative work so called which aims at
reality--with portrait work which I feel must be softened and flattereing?
Aren't they one?
<br />Why have I turned away from thinking about what to eat !!!! Sometimes
I make Wallace suggest what we might eat. To make him pay?
<br />Why have I felt shut in at the Icehouse--when it is so beautiful and
I am so fond of the plantings, etc.
<br />What do I lack in physical needs? Clothes? Food? Shelter?
<br />Would cutting off my hair free me of any strings or bonds?
<br />Do I want to die or be in jail again to be reborn--
<br />must one always become a captive to know freedom?
<br />What am I--a mess or something reaching toward light?
<br />&nbsp;
