            <h3> <a name="polaroid"></a>Elsa's FAQ for the Polaroid 20x24:</h3>
            <p>1. There are six cameras: in Polaroid studios in <a href="newyork.html">New York City</a> 
            and Prague, in the 
            <a href="http://www.calumetphoto.com/default.taf?pgtype=doc&item=content/polaroid2024/polaroid2024.inc">
            Calument Photo</a> Store, in Berkeley, CA, at the 
            <a href="http://www.rowland.org/">Rowland Foundation</a> 
            in Cambridge, MA., and my studio in Cambridge, MA. One camera rotates among several 
            colleges as part of the Polaroid Corporation College Program. </p>
            
            <p>2. I rent <a href="studio/elsa-w-picture-and-camera.jpg">Camera #4</a> 
            from the Polaroid Corporation. I have been using the camera since 1980,
            at Polaroid Studios and have been renting #4 in my own studio at 
            <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=955+Mass+Ave,+Cambridge,+MA+02139&amp;sll=42.3692,-71.1098&amp;sspn=0.008814,0.022724&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=955+Massachusetts+Ave,+Cambridge,+Middlesex,+Massachusetts+02139&amp;ll=42.369198,-71.109803&amp;spn=0.008814,0.022724&amp;z=16">
            955 Mass Ave.</a>, Cambridge, MA since 1987.</p>
            <p>3. I use Polaroid Polacolor ER instant color film. ASA 80. 
            There is another color film and black and white film, but I 
            don't use either of them. I stick w/ the film I know!!! </p>
            
            <p>4. The camera is 25.2" wide and 40.94" long and 59.06" high. There is 
            a crank to raise and lower it. It is actually a simple box, with a hole 
            in the front for the lense and a Polaroid film processor built into the
            back door.  It isn't as complicated as modern 35mm cameras I am sure. 
            There is a tray for pods which hold the chemicals.  Each exposure has 
            its own pod. I have been told by clients who are engineers that the pod 
            mechanism of the Polaroid camera is one of the 7 wonders of the world!!
            It is amazing that the pod opens up by the force of the rollers and spreads 
            evenly to transfer the image from the negative to the positive. </p>
            
            <p>5. The camera weighs about 200 lbs. It has a presence, because of the 
            bellows, the bulk, its height. Its <i><a href="studio/camera.jpg">gravitas</a>.</i> </p>
            
            <p>6. I use only one lense w/ the camera.  Made in Chicago, it is 
            600 mm, f 11.0. The closest I can get is about 10" below the chin. 
            Occassionally, at the Polaroid studio at the Mass College
            of Art I have used a close-up lens. </p>
            
            <p>7. The Camera is mounted on a mobile frame, sort of like a supermarket
                wagon frame. It is very hard to move the camera in a straight line, because
                the wheels like to zig and zag. The camera can be raised and
                lowered or tilted forwards and backwards.   The camera tilts
                with a simple ratchet, probably from Sears. The bellows can go out about
                150 cm, but it is VERY hard to focus when they are that far out because
                the focusing screen gets  very dark.   A simple tape measure
            from the hardware store measures how far out the bellows are going.</p>
            <p>8. To see the image, I look through a fresnel plate with a transparent
                strip down the middle. Everything is
                upside down and backwards.  In Camera #4 which I lease from Polaroid
                there is an amusing detail: the fresnel screen is held in the camera by
                pieces of metal in the shape of rabbit ears (perhaps a sly reference to
                Playboy magazine, which was VERY popular around the time the camera was
            built).</p>
            <p>9. I usually let the film develop for 70 sec. before <a href="studio/supplies.jpg">peeling</a> it apart. There is a digital timer on the side of
                the camera.  I decide how long to let the film develop, depending
                on the temperature in my studio, and the characteristics of the particular
            case of film.  Every case of film has its own personality!</p>
            <p>10. A case of film includes a roll of negative, three rolls of positive
                (because the positive is thicker
                than the negative) and 39 pods. I cut my prints to about 40" long and
                trim them to 36" long.
                Other people can get as many as 45 exposures from a case of film by
                cutting the exposure very
                short.</p>
            <p>11. I use <a href="studio/four-guys-and-a-light.jpg">Broncolor strobes</a> because I was told they are very good for non-technical people like myself.
                (see Philip Greenspun's section on Studio Lighting for a description
                of the studio and the lights we
                share.)</p>
            <p>12. The <a href="studio/camera-inside.jpg">negative</a> goes up and
                down with a string and piece of doublebacked sticky tape!! Totally <em>un </em>high-tech.</p>
            <p>13. The film comes out of the BOTTOM of the camera. I always feel I
                am delivering a baby or
                praying to a cameragod because I pull the film out on my knees. The
                pod end comes out first.</p>
            <p>14. I operate the camera myself these days. For the first seven years
                that I used the camera, I worked
                w/ fabulous technicians, notably John Reuter (an artist and now head
                of the Polaroid New
                York, Tracy Storer, (now head of the studio at Calumet Photo in Berkeley,
                CA), and Eric
                Harrington , now a framer and conservator.</p>
            <p>15. When the camera breaks, I start to pray. I call a cadre of people
                who used to work at Polaroid and
                are now retired, and I call toolmakers and technicians that I now know.</p>
            <p>16. I love the camera and its history. I love the fact that so many
                people who worked camera are still devoted to it. I love the fact that
                it is quirky and unpredictable and seems to have its own soul. </p>

                <hr width="100%" />
         
            <h3> <a name="studio"></a>Elsa's FAQ for the Studio</h3>
            <p>1. I share my studio with photo maven, Philip Greenspun. The ceiling rods
                and second seamless are
                his innovation. So is the radio!!!
            </p>
            <p>2. I collect wild chairs and benches for people to sit on. One of the
                most popular is the bench Alex and
                Philip are sitting on for the cover shot for their book,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558605347/elsadorfmanphoto"> Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558605347/o/elsadorfmanphoto">.</a> I have used that bench in MANY successful portraits and even once got
                an email inquiring where I
                bought the bench ( in 1995 from Neal Beckerman who used to have a shop
                in Brookline Village, MA, but now operates in Maine).</p>
            <p>3. I use 12' white Superior Seamless. Amazingly, I can't use Savage
                Seamless because the core is a
                millimeter too thick for the stainless steel poles of my hanging set
                up.</p>
            <p>4. The studio is divided into two rooms: one room is the camera room. 
                The second room  is a sort of <a href="studio/everyone-in-the-studio.jpg">gallery/playroom/chair
                    room</a> with a blue carpet on the floor and replica prints of my portraits
                on the walls.  I also have a fabulous <a href="studio/neon-sign.jpg">neon
                    sign</a> w/ my name, made by Neonwilliams, Allston, MA, on the wall. </p>
            <p>5. The camera room is about 15' wide and about 24' long. Barely wide
                enough and long enough, but it
                works. When I have a large crowd, say 24 people, I have to move the
                camera almost out the door. </p>
            <p>6. . On the floor of the <a href="studio/clock.jpg">camera room</a> I have marked w/ magic marker on the industrial tiles where the camera
                wheels
                should be for groups of 2, 10, 20. I need all the little aids I can
                come up with!</p>
