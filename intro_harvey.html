Bob Chatelle Introduces Harvey Silverglate at Ford Hall Forum</h2></center>

Old South Meeting House, Boston

<p>March 25, 1999

</p><p>I would like to thank all of you for coming here tonight, and I'd like
to thank Ford Hall Forum for inviting me to the Old South Meeting House
-- a crucial site in the history of American liberty -- and for giving
me the honor of introducing my good friend, Harvey Silverglate.

</p><p>Most of you, I'm sure, are already familiar with Harvey Silverglate
as Elsa Dorfman's husband. But Harvey is also an able and internationally
known defense attorney, a journalist and book author, and an impassioned
and brilliant defender of freedom -- especially freedom of conscience and
freedom of expression.

</p><p>Harvey was born in Brooklyn and graduated from high school in New Jersey.
In 1964, he was graduated cum laude in history from Princeton and then
took his law degree at Harvard. He began his practice working for Joseph
Oteri as an Associate in the firm of Crane, Inker &amp; Oteri. Since 1970
he has been a partner in several firms and for the past ten years has been
a senior partner of Silverglate &amp; Good. In 1971 he was admitted to
the Bar of the United States Supreme Court, and has been admitted to the
Bars of six Circuit Courts of Appeal, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals,
the US Court of Military Appeals, and others. He has taught law at Umass
Boston and Harvard. He founded the Massachusetts Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers. He's a former President and current Board Member of the
ACLU of Massachusetts. Since 1976 his column "Freedom Watch" (formerly
"Brief Cases) appeared first in The Real Paper and currently in The Boston
Phoenix. He is also a regular columnist for the National Law Journal. And
I am leaving out a great deal of his resume.

</p><p>I emailed Harvey about what I might say during this introduction. He
responded that if I couldn't think of anything else, I could always just
say he was a good speller. His email, unfortunately, contained a spelling
error. (In fairness, it was an obvious typo.) So I decided to try another
approach.

</p><p>For 14 years, my partner, Jim D'Entremont, and I were close neighbors
of Harvey and Elsa in Cambridge. So naturally Harvey and I got to know
each other over the internet. In 1990, Jim and I helped found the Boston
Coalition for Freedom of Expression and early in 1992 I became Political
Issues Chair for the National Writers Union, one of America's largest and
most politically active writers organizations. My chief duty for the union
was defending freedom of expression on its behalf. Mutual friends had introduced
me to Harvey on one or two occasions. And I'd seen him around the neighborhood,
sometimes walking down Putnam Avenue carrying a bouquet for Elsa. I eventually
summoned up the courage to write to him for a little help, and he replied
by email. He may regret this. Once I had Harvey's email address, I gave
him no peace.

</p><p>During my five years as Political Issues Chair, I became embroiled in
many issues, including freedom of speech in cyberspace. But I found that
I was spending most of my time defending both students and faculty members
who were being silenced and harassed by the authoritarian ideologues who
dictate permissible thought on our college campuses. Fortuitously, Harvey
had also become embroiled in these same issues and (with his oldest and
dearest friend, Alan Kors) was working on a book with the wonderful working
title, Where the Water Buffalo Roam. That book was published last fall
as <i><a href="http://www.shadowuniv.com">The Shadow Universit</a>y</i>. I don't
like the title as well, but it's still a great book.

</p>
<p>United by common goals and interests, our friendship began. Harvey and
I don't have a lot in common. You can find pictures of both of us in the
dictionary. For Harvey, look under Brooklyn Jew. For me, look under hick-town
goy. I learned essential civil-libertarian principles from my Roman Catholic
Republican grandmother. Some of Harvey's early mentors may have been Catholic.
But I doubt any were Republican.

</p><p>In spite of our cultural differences, Harvey and I discovered that we
shared much in the ways of values. We worked together on such cases as
the proposed University of Massachusetts speech code, the attempted silencing
of a University of New Orleans professor with unpopular views on race and
intelligence, and -- one of my favorites -- the shocking case of Miss Nude
Santa Cruz. (Harvey discusses all of these in his book.)

</p><p>Harvey and I both care passionately about freedom and justice. We believe
in the power of reason. We care about those who are deprived of their rights
and freedom by powers-that-be who consider some people expendable. We believe
that freedom and justice are not divisible. An injustice to one is an injustice
to all. When freedom is denied our adversaries, eventually we pay the price
by losing our own.

</p><p>While Harvey and I share values and concerns, we have our differences.
I am a pessimist (or perhaps a realist); Harvey is an incurable optimist.
Those of us who are pessimists desperately need to have optimists in our
lives. Which is perhaps why Harvey has attracted so many of us as friends.
He keeps us going.

</p><p>Harvey is also much kinder that I am. It's somewhat ironic that Harvey
so passionately defends the rights of those who say hateful things. Harvey
seems constitutionally incapable of a hateful word or act. Harvey loves
helping people, and the beneficiaries of his large and small acts of kindness
and generosity are legion. Harvey gets along well with an incredible spectrum
of human beings. I think it says a lot that his son's godmother is Andrea
Dworkin. Harvey finds positive things to say about people that I would
cross the street to avoid.

</p><p>In the many years I've lived in the Boston area, I (like most of you)
have read a great deal of rubbish in The Boston Globe. In one of the most
ridiculous columns ever, a Globe writer some months ago accused Harvey
of not having a heart. No person who knows Harvey could or would mouth
such nonsense. But Globe columnists have something of a tradition of writing
about events they do not attend and bad-mouthing people they do not know.
I am privileged to know Harvey Silverglate. As an archtypical hick-town
goy, I seldom feel confident in Yiddish. But there is a Yiddish word that
I believe describes Harvey Silverglate -- and that is mensch.

</p><p>So without further ado, I'm happy to present my good friend; Elsa's
devoted husband; Isaac's doting father; courageous defender of the unpopular
and falsely accused; mensch and civil libertarian extraordinaire -- Harvey
Silverglate.
