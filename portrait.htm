<p>Originally published in <i>The Journal of Photography in New England</i>,
Volume 2, Number 2, Winter 1981&nbsp;
</p><hr />
<br />1-14. I think about doing portraits all the time. When I'm without
my camera, listening to a person and talking to her or him, I think about
the picture of her/him. When I am doing mindless tasks like folding laundry,
cleaning the bathroom, or going to pick Isaac up at nursery school, I mull
over the direction of work and the problems in specific images. It happens
spontaneously. I spend so much time thinking about my work without a camera
in my hand, that when I do have the camera I can concentrate on nuances.

<p>My range of subject matter as a portrait photographer is specific. I
photograph my family and friends, friends of friends, strangers who pique
my curiosity. Occasionally, five or ten times a year, I work with people
who call and ask me to photograph them. I can talk about components of
what you call "the vital connection" and what I would call "what turns
me on." But I can't give you the complete answer. Sometimes it is the person's
personality. Character, perhaps more than personality. There is a sense
that someone is home. Sometimes, it is the way the person puts herself/himself
together. I get a sense of the person that I like. Sometimes, it is the
environment which turns me on. Sometimes, too, it is my affection and relation
to the person, my sense of the person's place in my world. I tend to project
charisma onto the men and women that I include in my life and these feelings
seem to help when I go to take their pictures. But there are one or two
people whom I love that I can't photograph.

</p><p>I always buy Tri-X film because I am used to it and because when I am
taking pictures I like to be able to go to my film stash and grab. I do
not pay too much attention to light, except that (1) I try to avoid having
people sit in front of windows and (2) I make sure I have enough of it.
Years ago, I would shoot in dimly lit rooms and I'd go home, push the film
to 2400, and pray. Now I'm too old for that kind of hopefulness. I am passionate
about making my subject feel comfortable with the shooting situation. I
want my subject to feel she is sharing the control of the situation with
me and that she is in charge of her own persona that she projects. I shoot
in available light, though I have been thinking that I should use lights
in some situations. A single flash is too harsh for my kind of image.

</p><p>I love Annie Liebowitz's photographs that I see in <i>Rolling Stone</i>.
I have never met her and would love to talk shop with her. I pick up a
lot of ideas about composition when I look at her images. Another person
whose work I like is James Hamilton. Usually I see his images in the <i>Village
Voice</i>. And Fred MacDarrah. He's not a portrait photographer per se,
but as a photojournalist, he often has dynamite portraits. He had a picture
of Jimmy Carter in the <i>Village Voice</i> before the election that was
as devastating as the best political cartoon. There is a Diane Arbus portrait
of a transvestite that I wish was my own image. I look at other portraits
to see what I can use for my own work. I usually ask myself, could I do
that / would I do that? I identify immediately with the photographer and
the photographic issues. I don't see the portrait with a pure eye.

</p><p>Only occasionally do I suggest poses for my subjects. My M.O. is to
talk to her and let her be. I never have a problem taking pictures of my
family and friends in my house. The situation takes care of itself. With
commissions and assignments, it is a little different. If I think I am
getting pompous pictures or frivolous pictures, I usually say, hey, this
is a little pompous. Or I ask, do you really want to appear frivolous?
This summer, I took a portrait of Jayne Anne Phillips for her book, <i>Black
Tickets</i>. She is a very attractive woman who has an aspect of frailty.
It is very tempting to put her in romantic settings because of her looks
and the clothes that she wears. She has written two books of short stories
and works very hard at her fiction. I was very straight with her. After
all, she knows herself and knows that she has this particular look. I explained
that I thought she was the most interesting when she looked like a serious
woman who worked hard at her work. We worried that the marketing people
at Dell would want a romantic image for the youth market, but we worked
hard at a serious image. We got a good one and they published it.

</p><p>I rarely impose myself and tell my subject what to wear. What a person
wears is personal. No matter how tired in the morning someone is, they
have some sense of what they are reaching for in the closet and on the
shelf when they get dressed.

</p><p>I have been tempted to be manipulative, however. Years ago, I was at
Anne Sexton's house taking her picture. She was very interested in photography
and knew how to respond to a camera. In fact, she had been a model. We
were in her study. On her mantel over the fireplace in a prominent place,
was a framed portrait of Sylvia Plath. Anne talked about Sylvia a lot during
the session and seemed both fond of and competitive with her. I really
wanted to place Sexton near the mantel, but I didn't. She stayed by the
typewriter and that's where I took all my pictures. For a while after that
session, especially immediately after Sexton's death, I thought I'd made
a big mistake. I'd lost the big flash by not asking her to go to the mantel.
Now, years later, I feel comfortable with my impulse to let her be. In
fact, Sexton was a savvy woman; she was probably testing me to see if I
could pass the obvious picture.

</p><p>I started taking pictures when film was about 50 cents a roll for 36
exposures and I never learned the knack of parsimony. I click the shutter
to encourage my sitter to signal that they were going in the right direction.
I use as much film as I have grabbed when I was leaving the house. Or,
if I'm at home, I use up whatever is in the camera. With prices going so
high, I am trying to restrain myself, but old habits die hard.

</p><p>Environment is important to me. I get turned on by clutter in people's
houses. The evidence of dailiness in the kitchen or the living room. I
am a sucker for women in uniforms at Dairy Queens, Brighams, Howard Johnson's,
PhotoQuick, Avis. The gestalt is my kind of image. These situations are
naturals for my 35mm lens. I don't even try to take this kind of picture
with the 85mm lens. Sometimes I make myself move back with the 85mm lens
in order to get more of the person's scene, but I feel more comfortable
with a tighter frame when I look through that lens. Though I care about
background, i.e., environment, I don't get obsessed about whether all or
part of the background is in focus. It is rare with available light that
I have the luxury of a tiny lens opening. I do as much as I can.

</p><p>I am sure that someone could go through my portraits and calculate that
I prefer to be a certain distance from my subjects. I am steady in my way
of seeing, in my relating, and in my habits. It has to be reflected in
my work. But I'm not conscious of where the magic split is. I have to discuss
it with each person I shoot. I do know that I love to hold the camera horizontally.

</p><p>In a serious shooting session, I try to include close-up hosts of the
person's face as well as shots of the whole body. Just to cover myself.
I've learned from my contact prints of a single person that my images are
very similar to each other. There are the merest differences that only
Lawrence Wylie and other students of human physiognomy and body language
would discern. I'm not frisky as a person. I like to sit, stay in one place,
and that comes out in my images. I once had the idea of taking dancing
lessons holding my camera. I thought it would help me learn to move the
camera. Help me stand on step ladders and boxes. Help me kneel and lie
on the floor. I even got the name of a dance teacher from my dancer/photographer
friend Amy Greenfield. But I never followed it through.

</p><p>I rarely make an exposure longer than a 15th of a second. I do what
I can with the light that I have. I prefer not to go below a 60th. I'm
not that steady. I have a tripod set up at home and I use it if I have
to go to a 15th.

</p><p>I have a 35 mm and a 2- 1/4, and I have used the Polaroid 20x24 for
an afternoon. I certainly get different images from the different cameras.
With the Polaroid 20x24, I took whole body shots of Allen Ginsberg and
Peter Orlovsky. Their bodies filled the frame. I never get too close to
my subject with the 35mm lens because I don't like distortion in my images.
I have an 85mm lens for the 2- 1/4. The square format is a nice change
and I go through periods where all I shoot is a square. I feel it is very
good for my mind. It isn't easy to arrange something in a square. I always
tell my subject, this camera takes a square image. So if I seem to be slow,
it's because I have to think. Rarely do I take all three lenses with me
when I am shooting outside my house. I decide which lens I am in the mood
for and work within its constraints.

</p><p>You ask what I'm seeking by making portraits of people. That's a hard
one to answer. Consciously, I'm not trying to make an interpretation of
the person. I know how unreliable the camera is in making likenesses. I
know I don't click the shutter when a person looks ridiculous. Usually
I don't click it if the person looks too vulnerable. I try to acknowledge
that my subject is a person. That somebody is home. I started to take pictures
of people because I like people. I appreciate their variety and need their
responsiveness. I respect their condition. Last year we completely gutted
and rehabbed an old house. In the process of finding the house and working
on it, I began to notice and to fall in love with buildings. I could probably
get into buildings, if I learned how to handle perspective. By then, probably
all my favorite buildings will have been torn down. I once asked Bevan
Davies, a marvelous photographer of buildings, if he got into his buildings.
He barely understood my question. It was obvious the roots of his energy
and his empathy for buildings was intellectual.

</p><p>Can there be dishonest portraits? My answer to that is "sure." A photographer
with a bag of tricks can do anything. But there is something to think about.
Personality is elastic. Each of us has a range of possibility. In my self-portraits
some days I look like a prisoner and other days I look like the warden.

</p><p>You ask if portraiture is outside the mainstream. Like everyone else,
I want to believe that my crucial interest is important to other people.

</p><p>Thank God most people like my pictures of them. If they don't like the
picture, I don't use it. Only once, in vanity, did I publish a picture
of a person who hated my picture of her. It was Anais Nin. She hated the
image. True, she didn't look 35, but I should look so good at 75. <i>Ms.
Magazine</i> loved it. Anyhow, after <i>Ms.</i> printed the image, Nin
insisted that they publish in the next issue a more youthful rendition
of her person. Allen Ginsberg, who is the subject of some of my best pictures,
fortunately, usually likes my portraits of him. Of course, he is the ultimate
subject. No photographer takes a bad photograph of him. You should have
asked if there were people who were absolute natural subjects. He is definitely
one.

</p><p>What kinds of portraits are possible in a single image? Are you asking,
is a single image enough? A single image is like a kiss. One is enough;
a whole lot is enough too. One tells you something. A whole lot might not
tell you that much more. On the other hand, there's more variety possible
in a whole lot. And maybe more fun.
