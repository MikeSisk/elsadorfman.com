    <blockquote>We search these faces, the silvery shadows, the garish Kodachrome
        surfaces, the yellow streaked early Polaroids, the elegant studio portraits....Dialogue
        begins, is born fresh out of our own deep, dread yearning.&nbsp; Somewhere
        in that dialogue is hidden the clue to who I am, if I could but understand
        the language in which it is written.&nbsp; Your history is here, too...
        written in fat faces and lean faces, happy and sad;&nbsp; written in rejection
        and acceptance, mother love, lust&nbsp; or honest passion.....(<a href="http://www.bibliofind.com/cgi-bin/texis.exe/s/search/search.html?dealerid=&qauthor=david+galloway&qtitle=a+family+album&qcomments=&minp=&maxp=&daysback=at+any+date&SUBMIT1=SEARCH">David

        <p>The artist will always be part of life and change.&nbsp; His task, in
            my view, is not purely receptive.&nbsp; He is not, as some say, a simple
            reflection of his time.&nbsp; I am more inclined to believe that the role
            of the artist can be an active one and that with others he has it in his
            hands to modify our concept of reality.&nbsp;&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.bibliofind.com/cgi-bin/texis.exe/s/search/search.html?dealerid=&qauthor=dore+ashton&qtitle=twentieth+century+artists&qcomments=&minp=&maxp=&daysback=at+any+date&SUBMIT1=SEARCH">Antoni

    It has been several months now since Princess Diana and Mother Teresa died.&nbsp;
    The world deeply mourned the deaths of these two very different women and
    has seen many portraits of both.&nbsp; Each in their own ways brought a
    sense of healing to many whom they touched.&nbsp; In a world where healing
    on many levels is needed--a world that is complex, fragmented, and inundated
    with media images--Elsa Dorfman's photographic portraits are open, direct
    and affirming, are healing and compassionate.&nbsp; They can play an important
    role in helping us look at ourselves as we prepare to enter the 21st century.&nbsp;
    Her friend and poet, Robert Creeley notes:
    <blockquote>She is a remarkable reader of people, hears and sees them so
        unobtrusively that there is no overbearing hand of the artist to contend
        with, or perversely -- to value.&nbsp; Her photos have extraordinary passion
        for their subjects, but nothing is ever sweetened or blurred.&nbsp; It
        seems to me a consummate art indeed which locates so clearly where people
        finally are, in themselves, and just here and just now.</blockquote>
    Dorfman's portraits take on the role of remembrances in Creeley's poem, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553262637/elsadorfmanphoto">The
        People</a>:</i>
    <blockquote>Wistful, <br />
        they speak of <br />
        satis- <br />
        faction, love
        <p>and divers <br />
            other <br />
            things. It <br />
            comforts,
        </p><p>it surprises <br />
            them, the <br />
            old <br />
            remembrances,
        </p><p>like hands to <br />
            hold them <br />
            safe and <br />
            warm.&nbsp; So
        </p><p>must it be, then, <br />
            some god looks <br />
            truly down <br />
            upon them. <br />
        &nbsp;

    Dorfman herself has said of her photographs, "Mine are the humorous.&nbsp;
    Mine are the most classical, the most simple, the most forgiving.&nbsp; <a href="death.html">I'm a healing photographe</a><a href="death.html">r</a>."
    <p>Elsa Dorfman has been taking photographs for nearly thirty years.&nbsp;
        Her current large-scale, colorful 20'x24" Polaroid prints are carefully
        composed in front of a large, white backdrop in her <a href="camera.html">studio</a> as she attempts to capture people the way they are here and now.&nbsp;
        Rather than searching for a private or subconscious self, Dorfman celebrates
        affection in family relationships and friendships.&nbsp; She writes --
    </p><blockquote>within families there is a web of relationships, but I don't
        want to convey uneasiness or distress in the portraits.&nbsp; Instead I
        want to create with my subject the evidence that they are surviving and
        prevailing.&nbsp; I see my family portraits--especially the megafamily
        portraits of several siblings and spouses and children--as proof of <i>affectionate
        endurance</i>.</blockquote>
    Her subjects are wide-ranging: her own family--her husband and lawyer, <a href="http://harveysilverglate.com/">Harvey Silverglate</a>, their son
    Isaac--other artists and friends such as Ralph Hamilton and <a href="Ginsberg.html">Allen
        Ginsberg</a>; a group of friends and relatives; a nude pregnant woman on
    Valentine's Day with her husband and a symbolic red rose; a young couple
    on Saturday morning only partially covered by a colorful quilt; two elderly
    sisters, and a large multi-racial family.&nbsp; Her self-composed fact

    Last spring, I had the pleasure of becomng one of Dorfman's subjects when
    I took my own family to be photographed at her Cambridge studio. Gathering
    up my three children from various locations in New England, together with
    our exuberant, one-hundred pound golden retriever, my husband and I drove
    nervously from rural New Hampshire to Cambridge, Massachusetts.&nbsp; Our
    dog had never seen so many cars, nor sat at a sidewalk cafe while his family
    ate pizza!&nbsp; Dorfman immediately put us all at ease, welcoming us warmly,
    making each of us feel at home as she asked caring questions about us each
    individually and about us as a family.&nbsp; In ten minutes she had us
    ready to pose, including the dog, who somehow responded to her magic as
    well.
    <p>Dorfman asks her subjects to dress informally or to bring props and
        so we came--in cut-off blue jeans, khakis, plaids--although by coincidence
        we seemed to be the "blue" family that day, each wearing shades of blue.&nbsp;
        We stood entranced in front of the special large format camera, of which
        only five were built, handmade in the workshop of<a href="http://www.polaroid.com/studio/20x24/index.html"> Dr. Edwin Land</a> (the inventor and founder of Polaroid).
    </p><p>She usually takes two shots, stopping to view and discuss the first
        print with her subjects, explaining the immediate developing process, and
        comparing the two prints.&nbsp; She is careful to let her subjects choose
        the final print.
    </p><p>She purposely retains the blotchy edges of her prints, and signs each
        portrait with her trademark India-ink scrawl across the bottom, along with
        the names of and/or occasion for her subjects.&nbsp; Her informal scrawl
        and rough-edged effect emphasizes her sense of informality, directness,
        and honesty, as well as her own personal relationship with her subjects.&nbsp;
        Often her subjects her subjects return&nbsp; for&nbsp; "updates" several
        years later.
    </p><p>But Dorfman's portraits are more than surface portraits.&nbsp; Her portraits
        present a "weird nakedness," "a talisman of real lives, returning people
        to themselves." ).&nbsp; She provides a way to "trust in one's nakedness."
        (Robert Creeley)
    </p><blockquote>Identity would seem to be the garment with which one covers
        the nakedness of the self; in which case, it is best the garment be loose,
        a little like the robes of the desert, through which robes one's nakedness
        can always be felt and sometimes discerned.&nbsp; This trust in one's nakedness
        is all that gives one the power to change one's robes. (James Baldwin)</blockquote>
    Dorfman's photographs are like the informal, loose garments that Baldwin
    alludes to, allowing us to accept our&nbsp; nakedness, warts and all.
    <p>&nbsp;The filmmaker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0800182596/elsadorfmanphoto">Errol
            Morris</a> describes her photographs as:
    </p><blockquote>:....a perverse combination of dime store photography and Renaissance
        portraiture.&nbsp; Elsa manages to take photographs of people and at the
        same time capture (perhaps better than any other photographer whose work
        I've&nbsp; seen) the act of self-presentation which is a central&nbsp;
        part of human existence.&nbsp; She's the opposite of Diane Arbus, who asks
        us to deal with our potential alienation from her subject.&nbsp; Here we
        are asked to deal with the endless discrepancy between how people see themselves
        and who or what they really might be.</blockquote>
    Dorfman's own personal biography may help us understand how she has come
    to be the perceptive and precise photographer that she is.&nbsp; Born in
    1937, at Mt.Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Elsa Dorfman lived
    with her parents and grandmother in Dorchester until she was six months
    old.&nbsp; She then moved to Roxbury, living in an apartment complex with
    other families, and close to a large extended family.&nbsp; Her father
    was a fruit buyer for Stop &amp; Shop, a large supermarket chain, and her
    mother was a homemaker throughout her childhood.&nbsp; The only books in
    the house were <i>Readers Digest </i>and <i>Book of the Month Club</i> selections.&nbsp; Dorfman describes her neighborhood as "totally Jewish
    and a Democratic one--I didn't know there were such things as Republicans
    until Roosevelt died, and my father said somberly that there were people
    actually celebrating&nbsp; and those people were called REPUBLICANS".&nbsp;
    World War II was seen as the event of her&nbsp; childhood.
    <p>Aftter the war, in junior high, Dorfman moved to Newton--"Cashmere sweaters?
        I knew from nothing!!"'&nbsp; While at Newton High, Dorfman spent a summer
        on an American Field Service program in Kassel, Germany.&nbsp; She describes
        that experience as a "huge deal" that blew her mind.&nbsp; "I knew nothing
        about the Holocaust and nothing about another culture.&nbsp; Also the family
        I stayed with, Mr. and Mrs. Hans Werner Baumann, were very intellectual
        and loved the arts; they had a keen aesthetic.&nbsp; I adored the whole
        experience."
    </p><p>Following high school, Dorfman attended Tufts University, majoring in
        French Literature, and spending her junior year in Paris.&nbsp; While at
        Tufts, she also took a number of creative writing courses, thinking she
        might become a writer.&nbsp; Upon graduating from college, she got a job
        as an editorial secretary at Grove Press in New York.&nbsp; She was secretary
        to Richard Seaver, the managing editor of the press and the <i>Evergreen
        Review</i>, and remembers typing letters to Henry Miller, Samuel Beckett,
        and Jasper Johns.&nbsp; As part of her job, she also arranged the first
        poetry readings of Allen Ginsberg, Charles Olson, and Robert Creeley.&nbsp;
        With a friend, Dorfman founded the Paterson Society, a fledling agency
        that helped to arrange poetry readings for those young poets at colleges
        throughout the country, as well as to publish small books of their poetry.&nbsp;
        Creeley fondly remembers the days of the Paterson Society and noted Dorfman's
        importance for Ginsberg.&nbsp; "I read recently a publication of Allen
        Ginsberg's which came out just after his death, from Zasterie Press in
        the Canary Islands--he is recounting several dreams.&nbsp; In one he speaks
        of&nbsp; the fact he is shortly to see Ellie, who will speak up for him
        and make everything all right."&nbsp; Unfortunately, Dorfman had few role
        models to develop her own creativity.&nbsp; As she has commented, " In
        1959 girls didn't graduate with a great sense of possibility.&nbsp; My
        only sense of being a creative person was to be associated with a creative
        man."&nbsp; With little sense of possibility, Dorfman returned to Boston
        in 1962, feeling somewhat defeated.&nbsp; Her solution then was to get
        a master's degree in elementary education at Boston College.
    </p><p>The following year Dorfman became a fifth grade teacher in Concord,
        Massachusetts. Dorfman writes of this experience; "I couldn't wear knee
        socks.&nbsp; I had to get my classes to salute the flag by 7:55; they had
        to read from the Bible.&nbsp; I had them reading short poems by Creeley
        and Ginsberg.&nbsp; They called me Miss Dorfman; the whole thing wasn't
        ME."
    </p><p>One of the parents at the school suggested Educational Services Inc.
        (ESI) now&nbsp; the Educational Development Corporation ((EDC) that developed
        innovative curriculum materials for schools as a place for Elsa.&nbsp;
        In 1964 she began to work at EDC, running the mimeograph machine and doing
        classroom teaching with the biologist Lynn Margulies.
    </p><p>At EDC Dorfman met a number of photographers and filmmakers. Berenice
        Abbott had just recently left EDC where she had headed the photography
        department.&nbsp; Her assistant, George Cope, who had printed Eugene Atget's
        glass plates with Abbott at EDC, taught her how to use a Hasselblad camera,
        develop film, and make contact prints.&nbsp; Dorfman was "hooked."&nbsp;
        She immediately announced to her poet friends, such as Bob Creeley, Charles
        Olson, Gary Snyder and Philip Whalen, that she was a photographer.&nbsp;
        She took her camera everywhere.&nbsp; In 1972, she began selling her photographs
        from a supermarket shopping cart at Holyoke Center in Harvard Square.&nbsp;
        Her friends were aghast, but she made enough money and reached enough of
        an audience to pursue her photography.
    </p><p>After nine years, Dorfman put together a collection of portraits of
        her friends&nbsp; at her house, <a href="housebook/index.html"><i>Elsa's</i> <i>Housebook --A Woman's Photojournal</i></a> (David R.Godine,1974).&nbsp;
        The book is an enchanting compilation of photographs and text by Dorfman
        as she records her own and friends' inner and outer lives at the time. <br />
        &nbsp;
    </p><blockquote>Relationships must have seasons and rhythms; constancy is necessarily
        the key.&nbsp; By taking pictures in my house, I get a sense of how things
        change every day.&nbsp; How my relationships change, the rhythms, who comes
        in, who hasn't come, who's busy, how busy I am.....Allen Ginsberg is a
        person dear to me in reality and important as an idea.&nbsp; About once
        a week I am in a situation that makes me ask myself, "What would Allen
        have done?" .....Nobody can get to me like my mother can.&nbsp; And I'm
        sure she'd say the same for me....One of the shocks of my adult life is
        realizing how much I'm like her.&nbsp; My hysterical Jewish woman energy
        comes from her.&nbsp; My curiosity for people. My social ability. My expectations
        and ambitions.&nbsp; I have her crazy ear for languages, a certain rhythm
        and love of reptetition of words.</blockquote>
    Dorfman first began to use the large--scale Polaroid camera in 1980 through
    the Polaroid Artists' Support Program, when Polaroid agreed to subsidize
    a session to photograph the poets Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky. (The
    National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. now owns a Dorfman portrait
    of these two poets).&nbsp; It wasn't until 1987, however, that Dorfman
    was able to work out full-time use of the large Polaroid camera in her
    own studio in Cambridge, becoming the only photographer to have a Polaroid
    20x24 in her studio (the others are in Edwin Land's laboratory, in Polaroid
    Studios in New York, in Prague, and in Berkeley, CA).
    <p>Elsa Dorfman continues her interests in "healing"
        through her work in a variety of ways.&nbsp; She has taken photographs
        of people who had cancer and in 1995 collaborated with the graphic artist,
        Marc A. Sawyer, to illustrate the booklet<i> <a href="marc.html">40
            Ways to Fight the Fight Against AIDS</a></i>.&nbsp; Sawyer, who has since
        died of AIDS, was founder of a national AIDS awareness and fundraising
        organization based in Boston.&nbsp; Dorfman took photographs of people
        with and without AIDS, all doing one of the forty things that might help
        AIDS victims,such as cooking, cleaning, hugging.&nbsp; The exhibition was
        shown at the Lotus Development Corporation in Cambridge and traveled to
        Provincetown, MA and to New York City.&nbsp; The photographs were neither
        political, confrontational, nor death-oriented, but rather were embracing
        and hopeful. (Although Lotus and other corporations underwrote the exhibition
        and its publicity, the artist took on the costs of producing the photographs
        for this project.).
    </p><p>On all levels, Dorfman's work evinces an intricate collaboration between
        the photographer and the subject.&nbsp; Her ability to establish that relationship,
        if only fleeting in some instances, is of much significance in a world
        where relationships so easily flounder or are never established at all.&nbsp;
        Deborah Martin Kao, Associate Curator of Photograhs at the Fogg Museum,
        Harvard, describes Dorfman as "effusive, intoxicating, and eccentric...The
        success of her portraits are measured&nbsp; in part by the manner in which
        the personality of the sitter(s), their unique humanity, absolutely fills
        the unyielding emptiness of the studio set-up....In the final analysis
        Dorfman's art acts not as a "memento mori" but as a "mement vita."
    </p><p>Two of Dorfman's portraits were featured in a major 1997 exhibition,
        "About Face: Artists Portraits in Photography" at the Fogg Museum in Cambridge,
        MA.&nbsp; Organized by Kao, the exhibition included works from 1850 to
        the present, including artists such as Matthew Brady, Nadar, Julia Margaret
        Cameron, Gertrude Kasebier, Edward Steichen, Paul Strand, Aaron Siskind,
        Lee Friedlander, Robert Rauschenberg, Joseph Beuys, Tina Barney, Nicholas
        Nixon, and Dorfman.&nbsp;&nbsp; In her text&nbsp; for Dorfman's work, Kao
        refers to Dorfman's perception of herself as a "literary portraitist" in
        the tradition of&nbsp; Allen Ginsberg, "aiming to picture what she calls
        the "uncosmeticness" of subjects, " and always being "sympathetic to human
        foibles".
    </p><p>Where does Dorman fit in the evolving and changing scope of portrait
        photography:&nbsp; Dr. Mary Panzer, Curator of Photographs at the National
        Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. refers to Dorfman's optimistic and
        healing vision as unpopular in a time period that is, in general, quite
        pessimistic.&nbsp; Dorfman's optimistic view of human nature and her ability
        to record the best parts of ties that bond family and friends are, according
        to Panzer, a true gift.&nbsp; Dorfman's skills and caring attitude allow
        this to happen.&nbsp; Dorfman's photographs help us to see the potential
        for one aspect of reality, an aspect that finds hope and healing through
        human relationships rather than despair or cynicism. For as Panzer notes,
        "Portraits are not simply transcriptions of one reality."
    </p><p>Dorfman embraces not only the "everydayness" of others, but also of
        herself.&nbsp; She has taken numerous self-portraits,
        alone and with others, some with humor, some more serious.&nbsp; She makes
        self-portraits on her birthday or when she may have only one shot left
        on a role of film.&nbsp; A particularly humorous one, "My Annual Hair cut:
        Diego and Me, Febrary 19, 1992," taken during her annual hair cut, appeared
        in the Fogg exhibition.&nbsp; A retrospective of twenty years of self-portraits
        was opened at the Naga Gallery in Boston this April.&nbsp; Virginia Anderson
        of the Naga Gallery staff spoke of the pleasure of working with Dorfman
        and her deep sense of humanity.
    </p><p>Elsa 's portraits of herself and others are important in our times as
        she captures a "now," a "here," and a sense of the potential of human caring
        and relationships.&nbsp; As she states, "I have a frank eye.&nbsp; It is
        open, makes contact, and doesn't threaten... .I am moved by the affection
        and the caring that people have for each other."&nbsp; And we the viewer
        can only be moved, too, as we enter the photographer's wide, compassionate
        embrace that includes both subjects and viewers.
