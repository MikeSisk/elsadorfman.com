<p>The M (ortality) Word and the L(ove) Word...

</p><p>People take pictures when they are VERY alive, but half of their brain
knows that the photograph will/might last longer than they will. That it
will show people what they looked like, maybe WHO they were.

</p><p>We accept the little death of the nanosecond the shutter opened and
closed without thinking about it. We are even casual about the passing
of the particular day. Indeed we don't think much beyond, Did I look like
THAT?&nbsp; What a good time! There we are in front of......doing....../
with........

</p><p>It's the big death, the final picture that&nbsp; becomes profound. Then
all the little pictures take on a new meaning. We who die become a shoebox
of pictures to others. Inevitably, those who survive us remember and try
to understand.

</p><p>In my work as a family portraitist, I have photographed eight people
who knew they were dying and wanted to have a final portrait of themselves
for and with their family. Of all the portraits I have made, these are
the ones that mean the most to me. It's an honor to share the intimacy
of the situation. I feel incredibly responsible to get a portrait that
everyone in the family feels is just right. And my heart is always breaking.
I am in awe of the bravery of the family members to come to the studio
and to&nbsp; be themselves on this occasion.

</p><p>Each person called me because he or she wanted a last family portrait
of everyone together. They wanted the picture so the child would have a
sense of the happiness and love that was shared within the family. That
the child would have a sense of the specificity of the family. One family
wanted the portrait "just in case" and to give the dad an incentive to
heal. Sometimes it was the ill person who had the idea of the photograph
and had to drag along the healthy partner and family members. Sometimes
it was the healthy spouse who wanted one more image. Once it was a group
of devoted friends. Each of these portraits was made with a sense of purpose
and with a sense of what was to come. A sense that after death the portrait
would really have its meaning.

</p><p>Each session was full of bravado, bravery, and laughter. There is no
other way to get through such a photo session. The whole idea is to make
a portrait that is cocky, joyous, daring. There is also a sense of challenging
death. How could death come when the photo is so real? How could the photo
END? How could the photo become what once WAS?

</p><p><a href="FAQ_nude_couple.jpg">Jonathan and Kevin and Tobey</a> together
a month or so before Kevin died. And two years later, Jonathan and Tobey.
Jonathan wearing Kevin's clothes, has said this portrait marked the easing
of his mourning.

</p><p><a href="hirshson.jpg">Paul Hirshson</a> told me he had the big C when
he got to my studio. He had just found out.

</p><p><a href="terry_death.jpg">Terry</a> came to my studio with her five
year old daughter Kathy and the two families who would care for Kathy when
she died. She went right from my studio to the hospital to have her cells
checked and called to say that they were high. The photo session had energized
her. She could feel recovery. But a month later she was dead.

</p><p><a href="jim_begin.html">Jim Begin</a> has written a wonderful essay
about having a portrait made. He was a wonderful <a href="jim.html">writer</a>
who has helped many people who are dying. He was very young but very old
and wise, from being sick so much of the time. He died April 16, 1997.

</p><p>Bernadette never smoked, but got lung cancer anyway. We took this picture
three weeks before New Years Eve, the night she died.

</p><p><a href="caroline.jpg">Caroline Graboys and her five friends</a> met
regularly for twenty years. Every year they went away for a "woman's weekend"
to have fun and talk. They all came to my studio for a portrait to commemmorate
their love for each other.&nbsp; A few weeks later Caroline came back to
my studio with her family.

</p><p>I never thought that <a href="dana.jpg">Dana Kellogg</a> would be added
to this series.&nbsp; He sent me an email before his second bone marrow
transplant and asked me if I could take a picture of him with his wife
Patrice and their two small children before he lost his hair. We did it
right away. During his treatments Dana made a<a href="http://www.marketwell.com/danak/">
web site</a> and posted pictures of himself enduring the treatment. We
emailed back and forth since there is no contamination in cyberspace. August
22, 1998 Dana, a fabulous athelete with incredible endurance and love for
his family and friends, died at home.
