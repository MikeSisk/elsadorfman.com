<h2>
For My Mother, Elaine Kovitz Dorfman</h2>

<h2>
11/11/12--5/12/99&nbsp;
</h2>


<p>
<a href="photos/elsa-disk35-0045.3.jpg"><img src="photos/elsa-disk35-0045.1.jpg" hspace=15 vspace=15 align=left /></a>
It is wonderful to be with family and friends who knew my mother and
who know us.&nbsp; We are so grateful that you all made the effort to bury
Elaine with us and to show us your love.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have talked a lot
about my mother, and of course my father, during the seven years of their
illnesses, and especially during the six days of our vigil at Elaine's
bedside. We've talked a lot about life, sitting with her dying, and realized
that bonds, among us, and among our family and friends are what matters
most.&nbsp; We are determined to make time for friendship among the family
and our friends and to try not to be too busy for what really matters.&nbsp;
As we sat w/ Elaine we all exclaimed that somehow we had cleared our calendars
and were with her, and our career worlds hadn't collapsed. We couldn't
believe it had been so easy.&nbsp; So here's to latte in Cambridge.

</p><p>We came to the conclusion sitting those six days and nights with Elaine,
who couldn't hear us and couldn't respond to us,&nbsp; that we each had
a different mother, especially me&nbsp; and Janie, nine years apart.

</p><p>We knew she couldn't hear us, even though the doctors would shout, Mrs
Dorfman, Mrs. Dorfman, it's me, THE DOCTOR,
<br />because we had yelled in unison,
<br />MA, JANIE BOUGHT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF ESTEE LAUDER
</p><h2>
and she hadn't bolted out of her bed.</h2>
She was definitely gone.

<p>Julie and Elizabeth, and Matt and Isaac had an adoring, attentive, proud
grandmother.&nbsp; We all agree on that.&nbsp; And we all agreed Elaine&nbsp;
adored my father. DORFIE as she used to call him. She loved the story of
his first day at the Stop &amp; Shop. It was one of the stories she remembered
till her last six months.

</p><p>I was always perplexed by my mother.&nbsp; I could never figure her
out.&nbsp; Even though she talked all the time and was VERY verbal, I couldn't
understand her.&nbsp; She never satisfied me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as
you all know, she cd never figure me out.&nbsp; We were agreeing adversaries,
So much of what I became was in reaction to my mother.. I have no idea
what drove me to that position Some of you can help me understand.. You
can imagine my shock that I look and sound so much like her!

</p><p>We daughters and the grandchildren have inherited Elaine's&nbsp; energy,
her genius for friendship, her interest in people, her love of conversation
and her love of gossip, or what we would now call&nbsp; the narrative of
people's lives. We've inherited her use of language. her ambition.&nbsp;
But luckily for us, no one is&nbsp; short-circuited in the ways I think
she was.&nbsp; Our ambition and energy find&nbsp; places&nbsp; to go.

</p><p>Elaine had certain mantras:

</p><p>Always change yr tires by November 11, her birthday.
<br />Wear white shoes after memorial day...
<br />Always bring something when you go to someone's house.
<br />Always send a thank you note.
<br />Get to Filenes Basement by quarter of nine or don't go.
<br />Don't get INVOLVED.&nbsp; Whatever the cause, don't get involved.
<br />Never pay full price.
<br />Don't sing song.
<br />Don't look like an immigrant.

</p><p>She liked to brag, I never get depressed. I have never been depressed.
<br />To brag:Stopping smoking is easy. I quit in a day.
<br />She liked to tell how electricity or was it gas came to her house as
a little&nbsp; girl. How she had stood there amazed..
<br />She liked to watch the fax machine work.&nbsp; She couldn't believe
it...
<br />And of course, no matter what any of us achieved, she wd always ask:
<br />WHERE IS IT GOING TO LEAD.
<br />I was always tempted to say, the Nobel Prize ma, the Nobel prize.

</p><p>When we were sitting around her bed,
<br />As she was actively dying
<br />We tried to think about when she was happiest,
<br />What being a mother had meant to her.
<br />What being a daughter had meant to her.
<br />What being a sister had meant to her.
<br />We knew what being a friend meant to her. She adored her friends.
<br />Sylvia Tarlin. Jean Lebow. Dorothy Ramler..

</p><p>But sitting in her tiny room, listening to her cough and moan and call
out names
<br />We couldn't come up with a coherent picture to her puzzle.
<br />Maybe you can help us.

</p><p>The one piece we do KNOW is her torment at her illness.
<br />She used all her intelligence to hide her forgetfulness
<br />She was very good at it.
<br />It took us a long time to agree among ourselves
<br />That the missing wallet,
<br />Taking the wrong turn back to the house
<br />Meant something.

</p><p>Elaine never got over her awareness that something was wrong.
<br />Her conversation was a poem.
<br />She sounded like Samuel Beckett
<br />She would ask what's wrong with me???????
<br />She would talk about how awful it was to lose her memory.
<br />She hated being separated from Arthur
<br />She hated&nbsp; sleeping&nbsp; alone.
<br />She wanted my father. She wanted her mother.

</p><p>She hated when I took away her telephone
<br />Because she called me ten,&nbsp; fifteen times a day
<br />Weeping, crying, begging
<br />Breaking my heart.

</p><p>The Saturday before her heart attack, she was dull, not high,
<br />on drugs.
<br />We need a telephone she said to me. It's terrible that we don't have
a telephone.
<br />She said WE, as if my father was living with her
<br />or was she living with Bobbie and Zadie,
<br />It was like she was saying, we need electricity in the house,
<br />we need gas in the car.

</p><p>Six days and nights we sat in a little room w/ our mother dying
<br />and we didn't kill each other
<br />we asked ourselves why
<br />BOTH our parents had such a terrible very old age.
<br />Who would have thought it
<br />during those sunny days on the Cape,
<br />those days in West Palm Beach,
<br />One parent maybe, but how come both?
<br />Of course, there is no answer.

</p><p>We sat there watching, talking, using our cell phones
<br />who was coming,
<br />who was sleeping with her,
<br />who was bringing supper.
<br />Julie, John, Liz, mark, Harvey, Janie, Sandy, me.

</p><p>We argued with the doctors.
<br />&nbsp;The MSPCA would have been outside picketing
<br />&nbsp;if a horse or dog were inside dying for six days
<br />We were perplexed by ourselves, by what we could be doing.
<br />we had no experience. Arthur had died in six hours.
<br />We even became&nbsp; philosophical
<br />maybe they were right, this was what dying was about.

</p><p>Harvey read a Supreme Court opinion about end of life care
<br />We argued with the doctors and nurses some more,
<br />a little like Zadie,
<br />finally we found a doctor who practiced palliative care medicine.
<br />And Elaine died in peace a few days later,
<br />w/ Sandy's yoga music playing softly.

</p><p>Now we are together with all of you who love us.
<br />We&nbsp; need you to remind us of the good old days,
<br />of what you remember about Elaine and Arthur&nbsp; before 1988.
<br />We want to hear about all the fun you had with them.
<br />We aren't daughters anymore.
