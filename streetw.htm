<h4>by Mary Ellen Mark</h4>

<p>with an introduction by John Irving. Philadelphia, PA: University of
Pennsylvania Press, 1988, 77 pp., $24.95 paper. 
</p><hr />A review by <b>Elsa Dorfman<br />
</b>Originally published in <i>The Women's Review of Books</i>, March,
1989<br />

<hr /><p></p>

<p><b>Mary Ellen Mark's</b> involvement with the runaway children of Pike
Street in Seattle began in 1983 when she and Cheryl McCall, a <i>Life</i>
magazine reporter, were assigned to do a feature story on the street kids
in &quot;America's most livable city.&quot; Mark, who has been a major
photojournalist for the last twenty years, made these photographs when
she, with Martin Bell and Cheryl McCall, was making the film <i>Streetwise</i>
on which the book is based. She doesn't explain whether these pictures
were spliced into the film or if she took them to stand on their own; in
any case, the interaction of the portraits and the edited soundtrack that
accompanies them is very successful and puts this book in a class by itself.
(I only wish that somewhere in the book it mentioned how to get hold of
the movie.) There is much discussion among photography critics about the
relationship of photographs and text, and many art photographers are combining
text and images. I am not sure that purists would place <i>Streetwise</i>
in this category because the text was actually created for the film. However,
I think the images and text of the soundtrack work so well together precisely
because the text is cinematic. </p>

<p>In his introduction, John Irving describes the movie as being as concrete
and inevitable as a good novel. The same can be said for the book. I cared
about the children when I looked at their portraits. The sense of hardship
and waste of potential came to haunt me. The text made me marvel at the
details of their difficult lives; it sent me back to study their portraits
all over again. </p>

<p>The 57 portraits concentrate on Lulu, Rat, Mike, Shadow, Tiny, and Dewayne
and their friends. Tiny's mother, who is an alcoholic, is also central
to the story. Lulu is nineteen: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She had been on and off the street since she was nine years old. She
    was gay, and at the time we met her she was involved in a difficult relationship
    with a girl named Wendy. Lulu was by far the most loved and respected person
    among the street kids. She was high strung and emotional and she had a
    major drinking problem, but she also had an extraordinary sense of justice. </p>
  <p>Lulu was constantly defending the kids she felt had been done wrong.
    As a result she often fought with men and women much bigger or stronger
    than herself. She always gave them a good fight and most of the time she
    won, but as a result of her constant battles, she often had a black eye
    and a scarred and battered look. Sometimes she reminded me of a sad but
    feisty old alley cat. Lulu was an extraordinary character and Cheryl and
    I were immediately drawn to her. When Lulu decided that we were O.K. most
    of the kids accepted us. (p. ix) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark and McCall met Erin Blackwell in the parking lot of a Seattle discotheque
called the monastery. &quot;Tiny,&quot; as she was known on the street,
was almost fourteen, though she looked twelve. Once she was assured Mark
and McCall were journalists, not the police, Tiny became friendly with
them; eventually she became a major voice in the book. (Her portrait is
on the cover.) </p>

<p>Rat and Mike lived in an abandoned building. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They introduced themselves as Rat and Mike and they were both sixteen
    years old. Rat looked more like a twelve-year-old and he was actually the
    leader of the two. Mike acted as his protector. The two boys were from
    Sacramento. They had run together after arguing with their families. They
    lived by begging, stealing, and eating from dumpsters. While searching
    for food in a dumpster Rat found a pair of roller skates, and he loved
    to skate up and down the hallways of the abandoned building. (p. x)   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book doesn't have a story-line per se; it's just a chronicle of
a couple of months in these people's lives. The portraits are honest and
the trust each subject had for the photographer is obvious. It is not easy
to make portraits that are as unself-conscious and unself-important as
these are. The children seem very real and have lent themselves to Mark's
camera with great generosity, which she appears to have returned to them.
(Mark is known, in fact, for her committed approach to her work and for
her respect for her subjects. This book is consistent with her previous
ones, <i>Falkland Road</i>, about the prostitutes of Bombay, and <i>Ward
81</i>, about a women's ward in a mental hospital.) </p>

<p>The differences between <a href="at12.htm"><i>At
Twelve: Portraits of Young Women</i> </a>and <i>Streetwise</i> are overwhelming.
Both have very high quality reproductions, but whereas <i>Streetwise</i>
feels solid but modest in your hands, <i>At Twelve</i> is printed on a
paper that feels absolutely creamy and sumptuous. Mary Ellen Mark seems
to have had a goal at the same time more modest, more concrete and more
ambitious than Sally Mann's - simply to tell the story of some of the Pike
Street children. By contrast, Mann's murky notion of what she was looking
for in the &quot;transition to womanhood&quot; and her cliched images of
pubescent girlhood only succeeded in ruining her book. </p>

<p>Note: <i>Streetwise</i> was published in the summer of 1988; by January
1989, as this review was being prepared for publication, the University
of Pennsylvania Press informed us that the book was already - after scarcely
more than six months - been let go out of print, and that there are no
plans to reprint it. We urge readers concerned about &quot;disappearing&quot;
books like this one to call and write the publishers in protest.<br />
