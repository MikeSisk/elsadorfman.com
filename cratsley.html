<h2>
STAR 90</h2>
It was inevitable that Bruce Cratsley and I
would get together. His brother John was our connection. In the fall of
1972 John bought a portrait of WH Auden for "his brother who's a photographer,
too" from my shopping cart in Harvard Square. $2.50. Rummaging through
the wagon John also found a portrait of an old law school buddy, sitting
bare chested at my kitchen table. It was Harvey Silverglate, my then boyfriend,
now husband. Another SALE. Another $2.50.
<div align="center">
<p><img src="cratsley.jpg" alt="Bruce Cratsley" width="426" height="645" /></p></div>
<p>Renewed friendship with John and Holly. And finally, Bruce in Cambridge
  in the flesh. We clicked. In 1975 he even joined me on the Cambridge sidewalk,
  hawking prints. The price now $10.00. Much talk. Indian food. Japanese
  food. Leftovers. Piles of photographs. That's Bruce and me. We talk about
  our work, our stratgegies, our printing, our "progress," our connections,
  our love life. We trade prints. We gossip about the grants we did and didn't
  get. What so and so REALLY meant. We egg eachother on to shoot more, connect
  more, print more, work harder. We're long distance friends. The phone.
  No email. No fax. He's <b>star 90 </b>from every phone in my house and
  in my studio.</p>
<p>Health. In the last couple of years it's been there right at the top
of our conversation. Occassionally lurking. So, how are you??? A couple
of times I've thought oh boy, this is IT, but the tenacity, the pull of
his WORK gets Bruce through the tough nights. He sounds AWFUL, but tells
me he is going to an opening, going out to dinner with Billy, making prints
of Venice, Paris. HOW???

</p><p>Of course I remember the old days. Bruce's long poetic messages to his
friends on his anwering machine, his latest impeccable acquisition to his
vast and georgeous wardrobe, his thrill at clinching sales at Marlboro.
And especially, his dogs Ms Muffitt and Sheldon, and later,Honey, coming
to life when they sensed Bruce was reaching for the leash. The promise
of a long walk in the neighborhood with Bruce and his inevitable camera.

</p><p>Bruce's apartment. A magical space of 900 sq.ft. packed floor to ceiling
with books, framed prints, grey arachive boxes, tie racks, vests (that
wardrobe), dried flowers, fresh flowers, ceramics, soft chairs and couches,
mirrors. Every table top, every shelf a still life. Who dusts all this
I always ask him, thinking of our friend Lee Witkin, who would come home
to HIS totally filled apartment and dust his collection EVERY night.

</p><p>Maybe Bruce's work gets its intimacy from its origins: shot on streets
Bruce loves, in museums Bruce loves, in markets, inside spaces. Printed
in the apartment, the trays at the foot of the love bed, Ralph Lauren sheets
and pillows in view, washed in the cramped bathroom, bathrobes, shirts
hanging, art on the walls near the shower curtain. Of course. From the
comfort of the apartment and the constant phone calls from friends (never
a phone call with Bruce uninterrupted) Bruce is able to work his ass off
no matter how he feels.

</p><p>Bruce's friends. Bruce has a genius for friendship. So many people want
to be with him, help him, go to photo shows with him, the movies, the shore,
the flea markets. Share the conversation. He has a special gift for zoning
in on women, he likes US and has a sense of what we're about. And he has
a talent for LOVE, finding it and nourishing it.

</p><p>The Yankee Scottish whatever grit that keeps Bruce going is the ultimate
act of generosity. By getting those pictures printed and getting them out,
he is letting us SEE the pieces of our shared world the way they seem to
him.

<h2>
Witkin Gallery, 1987.</h2>
Sitting in Bruce Cratsley's apartment in a velvet upholstered chair beside
his round table with luxuriant potted plants, mirrors, photographs, paintings,
in his world, with a stack of matted prints, his work, on my lap is heaven.&nbsp;
The apartment, two rooms, seven hundred square feet, with the enlarger
and developing trays in the bedroom at the foot of the bed over his dresser,
is layered with things to look at.&nbsp; Take an invenntory and you rob
Bruce's soul.&nbsp; It's all there. Placed in a context measured in inches.&nbsp;
Even after dozens of visits I find new things.&nbsp; (New things join the
crowd so to speak, all the time and Bruce hardly ever tosses anything out.)
This marvel of a place is the training ground of Bruce's eye.&nbsp; It's
his <i>locale ideale</i> that he goes out into the world and tries to find/make/remake
on film with his camera.&nbsp; Ms Mutfit is on the couch where I sleep,
the privileged houseguest, or she is smelling my dog, Moozer, and rubbing
against me.&nbsp; Sometimes, in a gesture of trust and generosity, she
rests on top of my sneakers.

<p>Bruce always has piles of new prints to show me.&nbsp; Glimpses of New
York, portraits of his friends' babies, shop windows he has found on his
walks in the neighborhoods.&nbsp; Bruce doesn't get under the skin of the
street, he stays with the surfaces, lingers over statues and decorated
masonry.&nbsp; He has an eye that rests on the ordinary.&nbsp; It isn't
probing or superior to what it rests upon.&nbsp; It just goes to its own
material in a familiar way, as if "Bad Boy" were waiting in the window
( for him to walk by) forever.&nbsp; How does he find his graffiti?&nbsp;
Magical words scribbled by others who don't know he exists and will be
walking by to savor/save their work.&nbsp; He even found "bruce" on East
Seventeenth Street.&nbsp; He goes out all alone with his camera, or Ms.
Mutfit or earlier dear Sheldon, goes with him.&nbsp; The work has the feeling
of a stroll.&nbsp; Of a man not in a hurry but with a job to do.&nbsp;
Or a calling.&nbsp; Photography is Bruce's calling.&nbsp; It's his whole
day (and night, the only time he can print in his bedroom) and gives&nbsp;
his day (read life) its shape, besides Ms. Mutfit, who gives him a schedule,
though I must say she can go an inordinately long time between walks.</p><p>Bruce is a master of the ten second bit.&nbsp; For a long time he was
into making elaborate messages on his answering machine for his friends.&nbsp;
They were short gifts to those of us who were looking for him.&nbsp; Sometimes
a little Mahler.&nbsp; Name that poem.&nbsp; Lines from Dylan Thomas.&nbsp;
His pictures too are bits, in this case, the ten-second glance that takes
it all in.&nbsp; Connected not by a philosophy or a hammered out sociological
or aesthetical point of view, but connected because Bruce made them all.&nbsp;
Why is Bruce's work signed by D.B. Cratsley?&nbsp; (Is it an homage to
literature?)&nbsp; That's Bruce's only secret.&nbsp; Everything else is
simple and open and in his work.
