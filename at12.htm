<h2><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0893813303/Elsadorfmanphoto">At
Twelve: Portraits of Young Women</a></i></h2>

<h4>by Sally Mann</h4>

<p>with an introduction by Ann Beattie. New York: Aperture, 1988, 54 pp.,
$25.00, hardcover 
</p><hr />A review by <b>Elsa Dorfman</b> <br />
Originally published in <i>The Women's Review of Books</i>, March 1989<br />

<hr /><br />
I have a son who is twelve and I am a portrait photographer, so I thought
that I would feel right at home in the world of Sally Mann. At the very
least, I expected Mann's world to look familiar. I expected to see girls
like the girls my son goes to school with (and whom I photograph). Since
Sally Mann lives in Lexington, Virginia, I realized I would probably have
to allow for some regional variation. What I anticipated was a somewhat
southern version of my neighborhood kids.<p>Alas, I was way off base. The twelve-year-old girls I know are absolutely
nothing like the girls in Mann's portraits. But the girls Mann selected
to photograph do seem familiar, and the images do have a familiar &quot;look&quot;.
I finally figured it out: the Calvin Klein &quot;look,&quot; not the hearty
Esprit or Benetton &quot;look&quot; I was expecting and prefer. (I apologize
for defining these clearly &quot;art&quot; images in terms of mega-advertising
images, but the reference seems so apt and concrete.) The sexuality and
boredom - and hint of danger - that I associate with the Calvin Klein-Brooke
Shields advertisements of a couple of years ago are omnipresent in these
images. </p>

<p>But the eminent writer, psychiatrist and photography critic, Robert
Coles, sees them quite otherwise. His jacket notes tell us that &quot;These
photographs offer a subtle and knowing visual statement about that most
poignant and vulnerable time, when girls become women.&quot; The operative
phrase is &quot;when girls become women.&quot; These 36 portraits are Mann's
vision of what girls are like, what they look like, and perhaps how they
feel, when they &quot;become women.&quot; Her narrow vision seems to focus
on latent seduction or blatant sexuality - take your pick. It is a vision
of young women that I think of as male (and very much like a lot of other
contemporary art and commercial photography). </p>

<p>The cover portrait epitomizes Mann's approach. Called &quot;Sherry and
Sherry's grandmother both at twelve years old,&quot; it is an image of
a large tintype of the grandmother resting on a garden chair while the
granddaughter stands beside the garden chair. Only her body, from her breasts
to her knees, appears in the picture. No head. Does the young Sherry look
at all like her grandmother, who has piercing eyes and politely crossed
hands? Does the young Sherry have her grandmother's marvelous crown of
hair? We will never know. The suggestive body is more interesting to Mann
than the family resemblances or the character of the young girl. </p>

<p>Several of the portraits are unfriendly, unsympathetic and unloving.
It surprises me that a woman made this collection at all. Not that the
eye is gendered - but Mann has the advantage over male photographers of
knowing what it was like to be a twelve-year-old girl. In fact, the frontispiece
of the book is a portrait of her at twelve. It is also distressing to me
that this particular view of how &quot;girls become women,&quot; all sullen
and sultry, should be as widely applauded as a profound vision as this
collection has been - and that its author should be rewarded by prestigious
fellowships ranging from the National Endowment for the Arts to the Guggenheim
Foundation. That these images can be accepted without controversy or discussion
says a lot about the image of women in media. </p>

<p>Then there is a class and economic bias to the portraits that makes
me uncomfortable. The girls all live in Rockbridge County, Virginia. Mann
explains that she had access to the girls and their families because her
father was an established obstetrician and delivered thousands of babies
there during his long medical practice. But most of the girls are clearly
well-off and well-cared-for: the six or seven who are obviously poor look
out of place. If Mann included them to be &quot;representative,&quot; why
is her sample so skewed? And why did she choose to make portraits of the
poorer girls in such a way that their economic disadvantage is an inherent
part of their portrait? They are defined by it, as if to suggest that what
is interesting is not their individual charisma but their bleak situation
and the overtones of violence and sexuality that Mann associates with it.
</p>

<p>There are only three portraits of black girls: one is with her infant;
one is beside her grandmother's laundry line (we're told her mother has
abandoned her) and the third appears headless because the leaves of a tree
obscure her whole head: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw her eye there, peeking at me through a tiny chink in the foliage
- cautious, the only sign of a child's curiosity. She had come out of her
apartment dressed as if she were on her way to a job interview. I was confounded
by her reserve and composure. I couldn't imagine what picture I would take
midday, midsummer, of this girl more woman than I... We did not speak.
She stood absolutely still, only the veiled eye shifting in the still heat.<br />
(p. 32)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether the girls are rich or poor, the photographer allowed no evidence
of the fun in their lives to creep into her portraits of them. There are
no cats or dogs. No records. No soccer balls. No favorite ancient dolls.
No Walkmans. No beloved books. </p>

<p>Mann describes her manipulative approach in stories like this one: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the early fall, I drank coffee with several generations of the Conner
family, the close air of their kitchen settling across my shoulders like
a shawl. I explained what I was doing and, as so often happened, their
initial suspicion gave way gradually to caution and then to curiosity and
guarded acceptance. They agreed that I could photograph Kelly. At dawn
on the first day of hunting season they called when the deer were beheaded
and hung. As I set up the camera, Kelly appeared, buttoned up, accompanied
by her mother, her aunt and uncle, her grandparents, cousins and a few
other family members. Arrayed behind me, they remained watchful and intent.
As I pulled her jacket back, to separate her white-shirted figure from
the darkness of the shed, I thought I might have heard a murmur. After
a few minutes I relaxed enough to identify the prevalence of the V shapes
in the scene and without thinking I asked Kelly to spread her legs. This
time the murmur was audible, but I see that the picture was complete.<br />
(P. 38)<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
