<p>What is it with me and not wanting to have my picture taken? At times
I've taken my photophobia to the extreme purging all family and extended
family photo collections of even the faintest shadow of my likeness. Unable
to understand my attacks on their family albums relatives have taken drastic
measures to safeguard pictures which I might confiscate and dispose of.
When Elsa took my photo I do believe it was the first time in my life I'd
seen a photo of myself which I actually liked.

<p>Why don't I like to look at old photos of myself? I think the answer
to that question lies in the way I approach life. Much of my past has been
filled with hardships. From growing up poor in a troubled home to learning
at a young age that I had a serious illness life never was all that easy.
I learned the best way to see the future was to always have a better vision
for tomorrow then memory of yesterday. Pictures, memories, even people
were often too much of the harshness of worn out times to carry into the
future. Periodical purges of revealing photos, memories turned to nightmares,
and old friends who were now acquaintances were all a part of moving on.

<p>The body has withstood much, battered and worn down by years of illness.
It becomes hard to think of having a picture done which makes you look
"good" to observing eyes. The years of waging war to simply survive has
changed so much of my physical appearance. Once a healthy adult my 6'4"
body weighed in at a solid 190 pounds. Battle after battle has taken their
toll and now 145 pounds of a bony frame stand up against the strength of
a strong wind.

<p>Changes to the body, painful changes, make if difficult to still feel
the same way about yourself as you once did. Photos often seem to capture
moments of pain as well as higher times. In old photos I often see the
pain of bad times or feel sorrow for better days that will never return.
The body has changed much. Bones now stand out where well developed muscles
once made me proud of my body. Ribs covered with only a layer of flesh
to define the wasting of a young body.

<p>I once asked myself how attractive a body could appear which had an
illness moving within it that would kill. A part of the vision is death,
the image is one of a body fighting a slow loosing battle. A part of the
vision is life, a spirit hanging onto its only known way to stay connected
to a fragile yet beautiful world. I have seen death in the eyes of people
near the end of their time, in the photo Elsa did I still see life in my
own eyes.

<p>I must explain the basketballs......., the logical conclusion would
be that basketball has somehow play an important role in my past. To a
strong extent basketball was once the center of my life, a skill I worked
to develop, and learned well. For this photo the basketballs are less a
reflection on the past and more an insight into an obtained faith in some
future beyond illness and life.

<p>During the early years of struggling with a serious illness fear of
death drove me to look for the answer to the hard question.... "what is
the meaning of life". I explored the traditional, investigated the non-traditional
and even considered the ridiculous philosophies of the world in a search
for answers. There was an ongoing effort over several years to bring together
some understanding of what life and death was all about. Working through
the fears of my own death I searched for a vision of peace beyond the world
I knew.

<p>I gave heavy consideration to several traditional religions, but in
the end concluded that anyone who guaranteed me the perfect answer to all
my questions was more confused then I was (but a confused I respected).
Next an attempt was made to develop a vision of what is widely declared
paradise or Valhalla or heaven. For me it would be a place of ultimate
freedom, perfect physical and mental health and where the company respected
each other for being who they were. My paradise was a place where I could
be me and be at peace.

<p>As I examined my life I worked to identify those moments when I had
felt on top of the world and in total control of my life. Memories of playing
basketball back years ago brought back feeling of physical strength, innocence,
hope and a faith in the future. For me a sense of peace came from remembering
back and concentrating on those good times. Running up and down the basketball
court on solid muscular legs. Feeling the full usage of my body and knowing
I was very much alive. It was a time when getting a decent dunk down and
working up a good sweat were the only cares I had in the world.

<p>So my vision of heaven naturally had to incorporate a basketball court
or basketball courts. Paradise is like any of the many courts I've played
on over the years. You have to know the people here, playing this game,
to know how different this is from any game that I could have ever played
in my lifetime. The people who come to this place are the people you see
suffering through life. The admittance to this game is based on hardships
survived, courage, and a spirit that endure more then most.

<p>People come to this basketball game to experience unfulfilled dreams,
make up for years of lost independence, and to learn how free the spirit
can be. We were the sick of the sick, those confined to wheelchairs, those
that people had little hope for, those at the bottom of society. Those
who wanted no pity but got labeled charity cases. Now the air is fresh,
the time is new and we are stronger then most. At a prime time in life
we were forced to sit on the sidelines, or live as outcasts. In heaven
we are the embodiment or courage and endurance. We stood up to the worst
life could offer and emerged with our pride intact.

<p>As I look at the photo Elsa took I think of the next stage in my existence.
I think about the place I will be going....... and I am not afraid. The
day will come that I am strong and free again, and in the dignified company
of those who lived life as I did. We will know the burdens we each suffered,
but our direction will be toward feeling freedom as no other group of people
could. I would label the photo "Heaven is the Freedom you Never had".

<p>The body has changed so much over the years. Gone today are the shirt
stretching biceps and chest muscles that I once took such great pride in.
Those hours in the gym were spent on short term vanity. Today I can look
at myself and realize all the health issues I once took for granted. As
with all poeple those days were only meant to last a short time. The body
is only meant to last so long before a journey is concluded.

<p>I look at the "big photo" Elsa took and I can't help but think about
what people think when they see me now?? I hope they would see a spirit
who fought one hell of a battle and lived the tough times with courage.
