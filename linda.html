<h2>Elsa Dorfman's Photography Reviews: part of <a href="index.html">http://elsadorfman.com</a></h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0863581234/elsadorfmanphoto">Let
Us Now Praise Famous Women</a>, by Andrea Fisher. Pandora. London and New
York. l60 pp. l987. </h3>

<p>The title of Andrea Fisher's book is derived from the title of the classic,
<i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,</i> by Walker Evans and James Agee, first
published in l94l and republished in l960. Hers is a very misleadihttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0863581234ng
title---the <i>only</i> thing both books have in common is that both have
text and photographs of the United States during the Depression. The subtitle,
<i>Women Photographers for the US Government l935 to l944</i> is misleading
too. That title implies that Fisher had written the book that I <i>wish
</i>she had written: that book would be about the women who participated
in the Farm Security Administration photography project headed by Roy Stryker.
It would be devoted to the work of these women--and answer the questions
who these women were, how they got their jobs, how they worked, how many
pictures they took and where, what their problems were in the field and
what their pictures looked like. It would include information on what they
did during the rest of their careers and what they thought about their
work and the FSA in hindesight.</p>

<p>The book that Fisher HAS written deals with NONE of this. It is hard
to extract from the rhetoric of the eighty page text that accompanies the
eighty three photographs by eight women exactly what Fisher is trying to
do and what her major points are. She writes:</p>

<p>&quot;The following essay is concerned less with the biographies of
individual photographers than with the terms in which each was made visible
within her respective moment. The social crisis of the l930's consisted
not only in economic collapse, but equally in an uncertainty surrounding
personal identity. At the centre of that uncertainty lay fractures and
change in prevailing notions of the masculine and feminine. Amidst this
troubling flux in the identity of gender, each woman photographer became
a site at which a naming of the feminine might be publicly propounded and
secured.... The essay addresses our desire for memory, and for the coherence
of historical narrative: a dream of uniting all the lost fragments of our
past, impelled by our fractured present. It addresses the seduction of
those materials we summon from the past as a play of our present-day desire.</p>

<p>You can see that this isn't a photo history book (and it isn't about
gender in any clear way either). It's too bad that Fisher went off on this
tack. Dorothea Lange and Marion Post Wolcott are well known and Lange particularly
is included in the histories of photography. But Esther Bubley, Marjory
Collins, Pauline Erhlich, Martha McMillan Roberts, Ann Rosener and Louise
Rosskam are FORGOTTEN WOMEN and it would be worth while to try to build
a case for another woman being written into the history of photography.
(After all, in the REVISED l982 edition of the authoritative history of
the medium by Beaumont Newhall only TEN women are MENTIONED.) Esther Bubley,
on the basis of the images Fisher reproduced, might be a candidate.</p>

<p>Fisher does none of this. I get the feeling that the photographs are
simply an occasion for the rhetoric. For one thing, the images are not
presented in portfolios by each artist. Instead they are sequenced to reinforce
the text. So it is impossible to get a sense of the eye of one particular
photographer without taking the book apart and rearranging the images by
photographer. And the number of images by each woman is grossly unequal
without any explanation, ranging from twenty five images by Esther Bubley
to two images by Pauline Erhlich.) Curiously, the book concludes (for reasons
unclear to me) with one frequently reproduced image by Arthur Rothstein
of Grand Central Station. Several of the images by Dorothea Lange and Marion
Post Wolcott are familiar which is a pity because they each produced a
large body of work yet it is hard to find images that haven't been published
and republished. Several images are repeated severely cropped as if to
reiterate passages in the obtuse text. This technique is very annoying
and does NOTHING to help us understand or enjoy the photographs---and it
doesn't make the text any more obvious. It seems to imply that Fisher<i>
writes </i>but she doesn't <i>look</i>. In one instance it seemed to me
that Fisher was dead wrong about what was happening in the photograph.</p>

<p>Fisher's essay has four sections and one four and half page section
titled, &quot;An Uncertain Exchange,&quot; is about her meeting with Esther
Bubley in August l985. </p>

<p>&quot;It was in no sense an interview, but rather an attempted exchange;
for an interview would presume that the truth of these images, and the
truth of their moment, could be spoken solely by their author. To conduct
an interview, as conventional historian, would be simply to produce another
document: an unassailable account whose veracity would underpin that of
the doucmentary images themselves. To interview Esther Bubley would be
to abdicate the unfolding of diverse fascinations in her images, before
the authority of her final reading. Perhaps, on the contrary, it was my
attempt to confirm those most private fascinations through our mutual recognition.'</p>

<p>So far as I know, in the photographic literature there IS NOT ONE published
interview with Esther Bubley. (And from Fisher's book we cannot even tell
if Bubley is still alive.) Alas, we have absolutely no idea how much biographical
information Fisher collected but decided to set aside for the sake of her
text. Her book has scant notes (all from obvious sources) and no bibliography.
</p>

<p>Yet, the twenty images by Esther Bubley make the book worth having.</p>
