<p>Having had so much time between my father's dying and today, I have
had a chance to think. I am amazed that a death so wished for and so welcome
is also so powerful and so sad.

</p><p>Although we live in the present and plan for the future, we understand
life in mulling over the past. And my father's death has thrown me back
into my memories and unleased love for him I took for granted. and questions
and regrets. Would've, could've, should've.

</p><p>It has made me very happy, an odd word to use today, to hear by email,
phone and fax that you would be here. It is very comforting to know that
the family sticks together and shows up. That even now, living in different
suburbs and different states, we are emotionally still a family.

</p><p>It is beyond comfort to know that my friends and our family's friends
care about us and want to be with us on this day we all know will come
for us.

</p><p>And it makes me happy that you remember my father with love and affection,
and awe. And terror. And curiosity.

</p><p>I've also been thinking about this plot of ground and who is here waiting
for my father. Here near where we are standing and nearby, God came early
and God came late. There is no figuring.

</p><p>My mind has gone to Maple Court and Pasadena Road and Blue Hill Avenue
and Seaver Street and the Mishkan Tefila. Grove Hall. Morton Street. Route
9. I've tasted Uncle Simmy's green tomatoes. Seen Uncle Abe coming through
the door. And I've wondered if I could ever find my way to Groton .

</p><p>My grandma Annie actually died on September 29, 1958. Today of course
is September 28, 1997. My father was such a good son I think it was my
grandmother's karma that let him leave us this week.

</p><p>And I've thought of cousin Paul Bellis and how all the people who loved
him and Florence trouped to Florida to honor both of them. And how it is
karma that Florence was coming to Boston for happy reasons and could be
here with us.

</p><p>I don't think children ever understand their parents, even now in the
nineties when we let it all hang out. Certainly in my generation parents
inner thoughts were hidden from the kids. There was no Oprah to give kids
clues to what was going on. No pop songs that gave the language.

</p><p>And back then men never said what they were thinking and feeling, if
indeed they had a clue themselves what they were thinking and feeling.
I cannot imagine my father saying he needed something from us emotionally.
That he felt annxious about something. And he absolutely never ever said,
I need your help.

</p><p>Many of you, Herbie, Sheppy, Tommy knew my father better than I did.
I knew him by what he DID, not by what he said or revealed. And of course,
what he did was always be there for me, no matter what my scheme.

</p><p>It's funny but what is most vivid these past few days is the schlepping,
the picking me up after doctors appointments, the writing to me every day
when I was in Paris my junior year.The warehouse. The sweet corn. The smell
of the cigars. My Hearing the toilet flush every morning at 4:00 a.m. His
puttering over his tiny row of plants on Solon St. The way he changed a
flat tire. My Picking him up and dropping him off at Ponkapog.

</p><p>The most loving thing my father did for us is he took care of my mother
for many years, keeping from us her vulnerability and his own diminishment.
He gave up Florida before he would have liked to and he left the Cape way
before he wanted to. He moved to the Hebrew Rehab so that we three girls,
if I dare call us that, could have our lives. It was a sacrifice for him
and a painful dilemna for Sandy, Janie and me.

</p><p>If there was ever anyone who was sure he wouldn't get old and vulnerable,
that he would take care of everything himself, it was my father. And you
know what, I believed him. I could never believe my father had become an
old frail man. I expected that he would be able to sling crates of oranges
over his shoulder forever.

</p><p>At the Hebrew Rehab he kept aspects of his personality to his last few
days. The first few years he read the newspaper every day. He never let
my mother out of his sight. Even later, when he was more impaired, he could
still connect. He was able to let the nurses he liked know that he liked
them. He was atheletic. he walked laps around his floor with his walker,
growling at old ladies who got in his way. He hated to sit still. He could
say NO. And he could get mad. He wouldn't do what he didn't want to do.
Or eat what he didn't want to eat. He could still be gruff. He could still
be mild. And he was still until last Tuesday VERY very strong.

</p><p>I will remember and love all of you who are here with us this afternoon.
Unfortunately, though Sharon is open and rolling and green, it isn't a
golf course.
