Elsa Dorfman started her adult life as an aspiring writer.&nbsp; In 1959,
having just graduated from Tufts University with a degree in French Literature,
Dorfman landed a job at Grove Press in New York, where she set up poetry
readings for the likes of Allen Ginsberg, Charles Olson, and Denise Levertov--and
chewed over the idea of putting pen to paper herself.&nbsp; At the age
of 17, however, Dorfman abandoned that idea in favor of photography.&nbsp;
"There was nothing in my life to suggest that the camera would be a perfect
instrument for my temperament." Dorfman says on her web site.&nbsp; "Except
that I was a starer."

<p>Despite the career switch, Dorfman stayed in close contact with many
of her writer friends.&nbsp; Allen Ginsberg remains her most photographed
subject, and poes like Robert Bly, Robert Creeley, Lawrence Ferlinghetti
and Gail Mazur have also been freequent subjects of Dorfman's work--in
addition to sundry professors, Pulitzer Prize winners, artists, musicians,
and mimes.&nbsp; Indeed, the career choice was a good one: over 34 years,
Dorfman's intimate, colorful, life-affirming portraits have been shown
in dozens of venues from Munich to Maine.

</p><p>In the early '80s, Dorfman's career took another turn when she acquired
an obscure camera, one of only six built by Polaroid inventor and founder
Edwin H. Land: the Polaroid 20-by-24.&nbsp; Described by Dorfman as "a
very large rectangular box," the 20-by-24 weighs in at about 100 pounds,
and the images it produces (immediately, as with the hand-held models)
are equally impressive; a whopping 12-by-36 inches.

</p><p>There seems to be no shortage of people willing to shell out $1500 ($1800
for a dog alone) for one of Dorfman's poster-size portraits.&nbsp; Besides
working as a commercial portrait artist, Dorfman keeps herself busy with
an ongoing series of self-portraits---such as last year as well as frequent
forays into projects she finds interesting--such as last year's widely
publicized "Bold and Bald" shoot involving three women who had recently
undergone chemotherapy.

</p><p>Elsa Dorfman lives and works in Cambridge, along with her husband, criminal
attorney Harvey Silverglate.&nbsp; She spoke with STUFF via e-mail.

</p><h3>
Do you have any techniques yu use to make your sitters feel comfortable?</h3>
I'm sure I have techniques, but I'm not aware of them; at least, I try
not to be too self-conscious about them.&nbsp; I do make sure my subjects
know that they are equal partners with me, that the portrait is a collaboration
and that I can't do it all myself.&nbsp; If their mind is somewhere else,
I can't make them seem engaged.&nbsp; The subject has to be engaged, as
to participate, at least in my kind of portraiture.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
You also take portraits of dogs--how do you make them behave?</h3>
I pray a lot when I know I am having a session with dogs.&nbsp; When I
do dogs by themselves, I work with Kathy deNatale, a wonderful dog trainer.&nbsp;
I couldn't manage the dogs and the camera all by myself.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
I imagine dogs can be temperamental subjects--is this why you charge more
for them?</h3>
I only charge more for dogs when I work with Kathy deNatale.&nbsp; I try
to keep life simple and charge the same fee no matter how many pets are
in the picture.&nbsp; I've done five cats held by three teenagers, a couple
with the\ree large dogs, including a 170-pound Newfoundland.&nbsp; I've
done families with pet rats, ferrets, bunnies, snakes.&nbsp; Luckily, cows
and goats and horses can't get in the elevator to my studio.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
You're confronted with a subject who just won't relax--who seems jittery
or just not "there."&nbsp; How do you deal with this?</h3>
Sometimes I let a difficult person be difficult.&nbsp; I figure, hey, that's
his or her problem.&nbsp; I turn myself inside out to help the person switch
channels, but some people are committed to their foul moods.&nbsp; I have
to say I rarely run into such a person.&nbsp; People who are prone to that
kind of attitude don't call me.&nbsp; They stay away.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
Do you ever end up with shots that you don't like?</h3>
I never let a person leave with a portrait I don't love.&nbsp; It is very
easy, because the subject and I see the portrait in 70 seconds.&nbsp; There
it is.&nbsp; does it work?&nbsp; How can it be improved?&nbsp; The process
is very much like performance art, very interactive.&nbsp; I take two or
three exposures and the subject chooses one.&nbsp; Sometimes they don't
choose the image I prefer.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
Isn't there an inherent conflict between the concerns of a portrait photographer
and her subjects--you want the photo to look good, they want themselves
to look good?</h3>
The people who come to me come because they want to look the way they are.&nbsp;
Now maybe they have spent the three previous days having a makeover, specifically
casual makeover.&nbsp; I would never know that.&nbsp; I take them as they
are, as they present themselves to me when they come off the elevator.&nbsp;
I love clothes with small stains.&nbsp; Rips.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did a great
family portrait recently and the dad had this great thread on his pants.&nbsp;
It made the picture.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
You've said that the best subjects are the ones who seem "at home"&nbsp;
Can you briefly describe what this means?</h3>
Well, to me "at home" implies "engaged", not vacant.&nbsp; There is someone
there.&nbsp; The someone is accessible.&nbsp; With kids it is easy, there
is always someone there.&nbsp; But people sometimes lose that sense of
being there as they get older.&nbsp; Something in our society perhaps rubs
it out of them a bit.&nbsp; Or a lot.&nbsp; Life is tough for a lot of
people.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
Do you find that your growing renown as a photographer affects the way
subjects behave?</h3>
Not yet.&nbsp; I'm a pretty down-home person.&nbsp; Renown doesn't have
much reality for me.&nbsp; I wait in line at restaurants.&nbsp; I do or
don't get tickets to movies.&nbsp; Sometime people recognize me and tell
me they love my work.&nbsp; That always makes my day.&nbsp; but I don't
come on like a rising star.&nbsp; In fact, maybe I disappoint my subjects.&nbsp;
Maybe they say to themselves "This is her?&nbsp; She really needs my help!&nbsp;
Well, she was recommended by Mrs. Speigel, and always goes to the best---but
could this be???"
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
Does the size of your camera unsettle people?</h3>
No, the camera intrigues them.&nbsp; It is sort of the size of a refrigerator.&nbsp;
Little kids who are used to pocket-size cameras don't even believe it is
a camera.&nbsp; They haven't seen anything like it before.&nbsp; Actually,
I think in the Babar stories, Babar goes to a photographer and gets his
picture taken with a biggish camera.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
Allen Ginsberg, one of your most frquent subjects, is someone who was "at
home' for you.</h3>
Ginsberg was a total genius when he was in front of a camera.&nbsp; I couldn't
take a bad picture of him, and neither could anyone else.&nbsp; He intuitively
knew how a great portrait of himself should be taken.&nbsp; He understood
the camera. He understood the importance of details.&nbsp; The commonplace
was, of course, his thing.&nbsp; He understood how to make an image an
icon.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
Who else has been a great sitter?</h3>
My husband, Harvey A. Silverglate, isn't bad.&nbsp; My son Isaac and his
friends are fabulous.&nbsp; I have been photographing them since they were
three or four, and now they are in their twenties.&nbsp; They know just
how they want to look and they know how to do it.&nbsp; Teenagers are fabulous
to photograph.&nbsp; They know what an attitude is and they know what kind
of attitude they want to have.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
Do writers generally make the best subjects?</h3>
I would say, without a doubt, NO.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
You own one of only five Polaroid 20-by-24 cameras in the world.&nbsp;
Do you know who owns the other four?</h3>
Alas, I rent the camera.&nbsp; I could have bought a Rolls Royce if I had
owned the camera, but Polaroid would never sell the camera to me or to
anyone else, so I am a happy renter.&nbsp; There is one camera that travels
between the Mass College of Art and the Rochester Institute of Technology.&nbsp;
There is one in a Polaroid studio in Soho, one at the Calumet camera store
in Berkeley, CA, and one in Prague.&nbsp; We all know each other.&nbsp;
We swap information and help each other.&nbsp; Ther cameras are very arcane
and delicate.&nbsp; They weren't made to last twenty years, and this is
their 23rd year or so.&nbsp; They were made for PR purposes by Edwin Land.&nbsp;
He wanted to show off the capability of his color Polaroid film.&nbsp;
He never thought of the cameras as a product..&nbsp; All the folks who
built them are retired or dead.&nbsp; The story of the camera is very touching.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
It sounds like you have a personal relationship with your camera.&nbsp;
Does it have a name?</h3>
I never named my camera, but for years I tied a wishbone to the bellows.&nbsp;
And I have always had a tiny toy car glued to the lens frame for good luck.&nbsp;
I do have a personal relationship with the camera.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
What would you do if it died?</h3>
Well, I ceertainly have wondered what I would do if the camera somehow
ended.&nbsp; Since I rent it, I knock wood every day.&nbsp; I mean, you
know what it's like when the landlord might just knock on your door.&nbsp;
I guess I would go into a big depression and then I would pull myself out
of the big depression and go on to something else.&nbsp; There was life
for me before the Polaroid 20-by-24 and there would be life after it.&nbsp;
But it wouldn't ever be the same.&nbsp; I would be brokenhearted.&nbsp;
I'm 61.&nbsp; Maybe the camera and I will fade out at about the same time.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
You started taking pictur4es fairly late--in fact, you were a writer before
you were a photographer.&nbsp; What made you switch?</h3>
Late? Maybe late for ballet.&nbsp; For gymnastics.&nbsp; For the violin.&nbsp;
I was 27!!!!!!! I love to write.&nbsp; I adore to write.&nbsp; At the time,
the camera was easier for me than the tyupewriter.&nbsp; I could figure
out my way with the camera easier than I could with the pen.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
How does your work now differ from the work you were doing in the early
days?</h3>
This is a hard one, one that I don't think I can answer---and one that
I don't think is my job to answer.&nbsp; I'm afraid if I try to answer
it I will jinx something.&nbsp; Jack Kerouac once said to me that he refused
to even think about certain questions. It wasn't his job.it was someone
else's job; the reviewers, the professors.&nbsp; I take him to heart.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
Do you make a living with your portraits?</h3>
I manage to pay my bills for the camera rental, my little personal projects,
my studio, my materials, my advertising.&nbsp; I couldn't live in Cambridge
if I weren't married, as successful as I am and as hard as I work.&nbsp;
It amazes me and makes me shrink from talking to young photographers.&nbsp;
How can I encourage them?/&nbsp; Work hard for 34 years and you will have
34 years of fun and love and stimulation, but the bills, the rent---forget
it.&nbsp; But I have noticed that young people are more savvy now than
I was when I was young.&nbsp; I'm taking a course now for small businesspersons,
to help me face up to the fact it isn't the sixties anymore and that making
money is okay.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
Does advertising in the New Yorker help?</h3>
Advertising in the New Yorker was a gas.&nbsp; I heard from old boyfriends,
old boyrriends of friends of friends who wondered what had happened to
Maggie from the party in Jamaica Plain thirtiy years ago.&nbsp; I heard
from old camp friends from forty years ago.&nbsp; I heard from frame salesmen
who wanted my business.&nbsp; And I heard from enough people who wanted
me to take their portraits to pay for the ads.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
You've photographed some famous people over the years.&nbsp; Is this ever
daunting?</h3>
I don't photograph famous people as a rule.&nbsp; It isn't my thing.&nbsp;
But sometimes there I am with someone really accomplished in my studio:
Julia Child, Allen Ginsberg, peter Wolf, Jonathan Richman, Robert Creeley,
Gail Mazur, Mike Mazur.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
Didn't you do Dylan?</h3>
I photographed Dylan a23 yaears ago on the Rolling Thunder Revue.&nbsp;
I was with Allen Ginsberg.&nbsp; Dylan was totally unaware of me.&nbsp;
I mean, he looked at the camera and was nice to me, but it was nothing
personal.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
Is there anyone you haven't shot whom you'd like to?</h3>
Madonna. Michael Jordan.&nbsp; I just said I don't photograph stars, and
look who comes to mind.&nbsp; Shows how inconsistent I am.&nbsp; I have
a friend who just died and I never made a portrait of him alone.&nbsp;
I could kick myself about that.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
Wasn't there a temptation to snap a few shots of Louise Woodward (Dorfman's
husband, Harvey Silverglate, was on Woodward's defense team), someone who
holds an inherent fascination as a subject?</h3>
Well, I did photograph Louise alone, with her sister, her mom and dad,
and with her lawyers.&nbsp; She was like any other person.&nbsp; I'm not
sure who would hold an "inherent fascination"except someone I had seen
in a zillion portraits, like Michael Jordan or Madonna or someone whose
character just screamed.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
Do your pictures ever reveal something about the subject that you weren't
previously aware of?</h3>
I'm not so interested in revealing anything about my subjects.&nbsp; I'm
interested in the surface.&nbsp; Sometimes I notice things when I am studying
the picture and am almost embarrassed by what they reveal.&nbsp; But I
don't try for it.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
I noticed a portrait on your Web site of a couple of friends of mine who
have since&nbsp; broken up.&nbsp; Do you know the fate of the photos when
that happens?</h3>
It happens.&nbsp; At least two couples have given the portraits back to
me, which is the best.&nbsp; I would hate to think that one of my portraits
was torn up in anger.&nbsp; I don't mid if a portrait ends up in a flea
market--that has a certain charm--or in the cellar or the back of the closet.&nbsp;
I always feel very sad when I heard&nbsp; that a family I have photographed
is in the throes of divorce.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
What's the most difficult shoot you've done?</h3>
The most difficult portrait sessions are the ones when someone makes an
appointment because they are dying and want to leave their family with
a picture of themselves robust.&nbsp; I go through these sessions with
a broken heart, and I work so hard to get a wonderful portrait.&nbsp; It's
a great honor to me to be asked to take such a photograph.
<br />&nbsp;
<h3>
How about the oddest?</h3>
The oddest ones are the ones who call up and want some sort of sexy portrait.&nbsp;
They never send in a deposit, never leave their real names, and never show
up.&nbsp; Thank God.</body>
