<p>At about 9:20 or so Inger and I went up on the roof to sit in our
  garden and go over some details of the next issue of the magazine. A
  neighbor was up there, with a stranger (who had come from two buildings
  over across the roofs) and in response to our question, what are you doing,
  since they were staring blankly to the southwest, they pointed mutely over
  the low roofs of Chinatown to the World Trade Center. When we turned, we
  saw the twin towers, upright against the far horizon, but in the center of
  a deadly calm-and with a rip in their patterned sides through which one
  stared . A brilliant blue sky surrounded the massive austere rectangles
  that dominated the landscape of Lower Manhattan, not a plane in sight,
  without the slightest movement nearby as if all was unnaturally calm and
  the strange black hole in the center of their silver spires was only a rent
  in a movie screen. The ribbons of orange flickering from white and grey
  curleycues of smoke appeared artificial. The scream of the ambulances had
  not really begun, so the Bowery which echoes normally to truck traffic
  cupped only the usual rumble that rocks our building, which has come to
  sound like the wash of the sea in the neighborhood's ears. The sky was so
  intensely baby blue in the warm September sky that it back-lit these silver
  towers and the scrolls of black smoke and white that girdled a part of
  their slender forms. One clearly saw the holes where the planes had crashed
  in and the damage but how could we believe what we witnessed? Was it an
  illusion, the trick of some cinema projection.
</p>
<p>
       "It was a mistake, a horrible miscalculation," so the first reports
that our neighbor was hearing on her little radio, plugged by a tiny
speaker into one of her ears, told us. It was, however, inconceivable, that
a pilot could not have seen the towers and so the first information on this
radio that a controller had made a mistake just made the holes in the
building, the black smoke pouring from it, and the flame licking the edges
above and below the smoke,  harder to believe.
</p><p>
      "Two buildings, two planes making a mistake?" the landlord who had
come up in the interim, after we banged on his door, running down, to alert
everyone of what were seeing from our roof. "No, this is a terrorist
attack." And so it proved. What was awful was the hope, since the buildings
seemed unshakable as the smoke and fire went on and on for over a half an
hour after the planes crashed into them, that somehow they could reach the
people stranded on those many floors above the collision. We stood there
watching, trying to disbelieve, to repair the now opening rip in the silver
spires, or call into play the idea of hope. Where were the rescue
helicopters, or the fire hoses? The sky was empty, empty, far, far away one
could see a  helicopter but the buildings swam alone far beyond the city,
gone already into another reality, even while they remained in this, so
high above the rest of the city,  abandoned by it, even the Woolworth
building stranded leagues away. Over the radio, and from phone
conversations, we heard that people were jumping from the windows, but we
couldn't make sense of the black hole, the abyss, into which they were
fated to disappear. I went downstairs to to call my managing editor, gather
up papers. If I ignored what I saw, perhaps I could keep them aloft. At
9:40 I still thought I could go up to City College and teach a class. By
9:50, with my briefcase in hand, and a tie around my neck, Inger, and my
neighbors told me I was crazy to think I could get up there. The subways
were shutting down and it seemed insane to try to get a taxi with people in
real distress having to get uptown from the disaster. I was downstairs when
the first tower fell, so was Inger, but on the roof to witness the second
collapse. That was the most terrible and uncanny of moments for it
pulverized before us in instants where formerly it had stood with its
sibling, as if to defy the assault, in a partial sheet of smoke three
quarters of the way up, the very edge licked by fire, but still intact both
above and below where the plane had crashed through, still sleek, silvery,
but already turning from an image of power into pathos. Before the moment
that the first disappeared it seemed as if the structures would survive. I
saw the second tower crumble a second after the explosion, though again,
there seemed to me little noise, a slight rumble through the roof or
perhaps the noise was swallowed up in the horror of the sight, the cloud of
smoke and fragments, a sudden evil fireworks display, aluminum fragment
shimmering like shooting stars.  I had almost deliberately looked away,
afraid to stare continually at the horror, as if that would somehow bring
it on, my attention diverted, even as we heard on the radio that it was
leaning, about to possibly crash. And Inger cried, "Oh my God, it's
collapsing."
</p><p>
      Then I heard, not a roar, but the cry of the ambulances as if there
was some hope there and still hear them renewing again and again and
through the morning and afternoon, now evening a silent queue of shocked
people were making their way along the Bowery uptown. We are both numb. It
seems outrageous having been this close to a catastrophe to continue with
one's work. Despite the sight of the towers so close, in flame, and the
sight of one crumbling before one's eyes I still can't believe what has
happened. The wind happily was blowing away from our buildings though ten
blocks or so down the debris was caking the sidewalks. Cars from this zone,
thick with the powder of the collapse, an ashen sand storm, came by from
time to time. Had the wind shifted we all  surely would have been driven,
choking from the roof, the lofts, refugees joining the exodus below. This
way we stood like Shaw's characters, in the garden of Heartbreak House,
watching the planes for World War One wing on their way overhead, as if in
a stage set, our garden with blushing green and red apple trees, purple
plums, golden grapes, the blue, blue background of a beautiful day, a hot
sun, mocking the nightmare, the cloudless sky giving it a freakish clarity.
Below us the trucks of this district, clogged the intersections, intent on
their purposes and everyday errands, as the ambulances struggled to go
uptown from the disaster, and maneuver around the big rigs that surged into
the middle of the broad Bowery from narrow Hester Street, trying to beat
the light, but stuck in the frozen line of traffic. At this corner, there
were no policemen in sight while minutes now ticked into an hour since the
collapse; and the trucks seemed to regard it as a normal day.
</p><p>
       Across the sidewalks crowded with a long line of quiet refugees
walking, since the subways had now shutdown and the buses were caught in
the chaos from the downtown offices, streaming in business suits and office
skirts up the Bowery and over the Manhattan Bridge, cartons of groceries
were hauled. From our roof, I cursed this indifference but the sober lines
of survivors, letting the cross sidewalk commerce pass, seemed to halt, as
if reassured by the show of the normal business of the street.
