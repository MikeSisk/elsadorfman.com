David and Patricia O'Connell were the first people I photographed on
the couch, They have a moving company and I hired them to move the couch
from Antiques 'N Oddities in Waltham where Mildred Beckwith, Gail Mazur's
mother, had found it for me. I met the O'Connells in a funny circumstance.
Christmas 1972, I was selling my photographs from a shopping cart at Holyoke
Center on Saturdays. One day, there was snow on the ground and I couldn't
figure out how I would get through the six blocks from here to there. The
wagon wheels wouldn't turn. I didn't want to bother Gail Mazur or Bobbi
Carrey, my only friends with station wagons. Why not call one of the movers
who advertise in the Boston Phoenix classified'! The O'Connells had the
most amiable listing.&nbsp;

<p>I took four rolls of film of Alan Lelchuk for the jacket of his new
book, <i>Miriam at Thirty-Four</i>. Neither of us could decide what kind
of picture it should be. Should he be nonchalant -- shooting baskets in
the playground across the street? Serious -- among the daffodils in the
backyard? Congenial -- having tea at the kitchen table'! Resourceful --
talking to women who happen to be walking up Flagg Street? We tried everything.
I made postcards of the best shots and sent them to him in Canaan, New
Hampshire.

</center>
Willy Williams used to clean my mother's house every other Tuesday. When
my father retired, my mother decided that it was too extravagant of her
to spend so much money, so I asked Willy to come to my house on the second
Tuesday. I am always relieved when he pulls up in his huge brown Chrysler
station wagon. He whizzes through my house, shining the windows, vacuuming,
polishing floors, organizing my cellar, advising me on how to get rid of
mice, how to get my flowers in the front yard to flourish. He can't understand
why I won't let him use any of those napalm-like stove cleaners, why I'd
rather have a slightly less clean oven.

  John Limon is one of those people you hear a lot about at Harvard, but
rarely come across. Someone who gets into Harvard because he's a mathematical
whiz and then goes on to graduate summa cum laude in English literature.
Someone who comes in as a shy and reclusive freshman and leaves with three
good friends and lots of acquaintances among students and faculty. Someone
who ignores the college literary scene and all the undergraduate publications
-- Advocate, Crimson, Independent, Lampoon -- and then has two finished
novels making the rounds of publishers in New York when he gets his diploma.
</p><a href="images/house_lg51.jpg"><br />
  <img src="house_sm51.jpg" border=0 height=300 width=425 alt="photo of John Limon by Elsa Dorfman" /></a>
<p>I met him during a year that he had taken off to finish his second novel,
  and hired him to help me sort negatives. I liked him right away -- though
  I said to myself, this is someone with a vicious eye for detail, God help
  me if he ever makes fun of me in anything he writes.</p>
<p>Most of my pictures of John are the last exposures on a roll of film
  of someone else. This would happen when he was working in my living room
  when I'd come home from a day of shooting. Let me finish this roll of film
  on you, I'd say.</p>
<p>John doesn't look like his picture of himself, although it's the best
  picture of him I have. Of course, he must have looked something like he
  looks here, at least for the instant of the exposure. But it's not the
  whole picture.</p>
<p>This confusion about what is/what appears to be, this ambiguity, is
  what attracts me to photography in general and to portrait photography
  in particular. Portrait photographs aren't the whole person, the real person.
  They are one mini-second, only as representative as any other mini-second
  would be. Because the camera gives us a tangible record of what just happened,
  that instant has an authority of its own. We can hold a piece of paper
  in our hand. We attribute reality to portrait photographs because they
  take off from the actual, have elements of what we call real. They are
  immediately recognizable. Portraits seem true, too, because we know the
  person had to have been there.in front of the lens for the image to register
  on the film (unlike a painting where the subject and painter can be on
  opposite sides of the globe). If John was there on the couch while I opened
  the camera shutter, that's his face, his jacket, how can I say he doesn't
  really look like the picture'?</p>
<p>It's that insistence on presence, the participation of the subject,
  that gives that misleading sense of definition to the portrait. We endow
  portrait photographs with all kinds of mystical/spiritual qualities. They
  seem so real and yet they're no more real than blatant fantasy. It's all
  resemblances, and it's all time. We are given this evidence of an instant
  when we all know time is a continuum. The photograph is an exquisite metaphor,
  a delicate haiku of memory.

</p>
<p>Seymour Simckes is a novelist and playwright; Anya an actress, a Canadian
  born in China. They are both very gentle people and I always love to see
  them. Seymour's father was a rabbi and it was he who arranged for me to
  take photographs in holy but deserted Blue Hill Avenue Orthodox synagogues.
  Since I'd grown up on Blue Hill Avenue, that meant a great deal to me.

</p>
<p>The picture of Christina is from winter 1971. Andy had gone to California
  and she was trying to manage Nicholas all by herself, as well as do some
  weaving, macrame, poems. It was an exhausting and sad time.

</p>
<p>Bobbie Creeley is one of those people you never forget. I've known her
  as long as I've known Bob, since I was twenty-two. She's unlike anyone
  you'd ever meet growing up in Jewish Boston; she comes from west Texas
  and by the time she was eighteen, she knew she wanted to get out of there.
  And she did.</p>
<p>For a long time, I only knew that she was wise, direct, and very practical.
  She has this way of being able to zero in on a situation. When she's in
  the room, she's the person who's in charge. It may look like she's not
  paying attention, but just try something. She knows when it's time to leave,
  before the roof falls in, before you make a fool of yourself. She's the
  person who reads the map; who says, 'Let's go to another garage and see
  what they'll charge' [whereas Bob and I would stay where we were and pay].
  There have been times in my life when I've heard her voice in my head,
  much more straight-to-the-point than my own, 'Don't you see -- he's trying
  to do a number on you?'</p>
<p>Once, a long time ago, during the Paterson Society days, 1960, 1961,
  Bobbie, Bob, and I and some friends were sitting around with a new Polaroid
  camera. We undid the box. Bob and I were already discouraged, not interested;
  we'd rather talk than fiddle with this thing that won't work anyhow. But
  Bobbie jumped right in; took the whole kit on her lap, read the directions;
  figured out how it worked. Took pictures. When I was twenty-two, I wanted
  to be just like her.</p>
<p>Bobbie has her own language; it's west Texas/California hipster -- circuitous
  sentences and winding ideas, use of particular words, and cadence. I can't
  reproduce it from memory, but you can hear it in her prose. About four
  years ago, she began to write short stories about her west Texas relatives
  and to publish them. Then she decided to use her own name, Bobbie Louise
  Hawkins. When she was here in April 1973, it was the first time she'd come
  to Cambridge by herself, without kids, without Bob.</p>

  </center>
  
In winter 1972, Ralph Hoagland, who owns the Orson Welles Cinema, got
  a bright idea: I should take pictures of him and his wife Molly making
  love. I thought about it for a couple of days (was Ralph, whom I scarcely
  know, crazy or just incredibly sentimental?) and decided, why not. The

  Idea</a>, for Ralph. In their picture here, Ralph and Molly have come to
  get some prints and the first copies of the book. We gab and giggle, Molly
  describing how Ralph tricked her into getting on a plane to Puerto Rico
  for their fifteenth wedding anniversary. He had told her they were picking
  up a film director who was on crutches and needed their help getting down
  the ramp.

</p>
<p>Summer 1972 Harvey and I went up to visit Hannah Green and John Wesley
  in Peterborough, New Hampshire. I took pictures of Hannah in front of the
  farmhouse, inside the barn, in an open field by the pond; they weren't
  spectacular. And we wanted one for the jacket of her book, The Dead of
  the House. So Hannah and John came to Cambridge and we tried some in my
  backyard. They worked.</p>
<p>When I had my show at Boston City Hall in October 1971, Hannah and John
  drove all the way down from Peterborough to see it. But unfortunately,
  three days before, Mayor Kevin White had made me take it down because he
  was having a banquet for big-city mayors in the gallery where it was hanging.
  He was trying to impress the mayors, especially Alioto and Lindsay, and
  the media who would cover The Event, and didn't want them 'to see all the
  sad faces in those depressing photographs.' When I got furious that he
  suddenly wanted the whole installation down after all that work, he said,
  'You look cute when you're angry, my dear, but it's my city hall. If they
  were Rembrandts and I wanted them down, they'd come down.' When Hannah
  and John got there after that long drive, and it was a hot day, all they
  saw was a huge empty space. 'Elsa Dorfman? Never heard of her,' the guard
  told them.

</p>
<p>I met Chris Long in Paragon Park in June 1969. She was there with a
  friend; I was there with Mark and Inger, taking pictures for a story we
  were doing together. I stopped Chris in front of the Swiss Boy Rotoride
  and asked her if I could take her picture. She thought I was crazy, but
  posed anyhow. She was wearing a bikini and drinking a Coke. I didn't write
  down her name.</p>
<p>Later, I put her picture in a display in the Cambridge Trust bank window.
  All her friends -- and even strangers -- told her that her picture was
  in the bank window. She didn't believe them. When she saw it, she called
  me and came right over to get prints. As soon as I heard she collected
  antique dresses, I said, 'Let's take pictures again.'

</p>
<p>Tom Pickard, his wife Connie, and their two children came to visit Andy
  and Christina Wylie in February 1971 and stayed the whole month. Tom needed
  a picture for his book Guttersnipe, that Ferlinghetti was publishing, so
  the very day he arrived I took his picture. It was a good thing, too, because
  it was the only picture I took of him the whole time he was here.

</p>
<p>Harriet Rosenstein is the first biographer I have known. She is writing
  a book about Sylvia Plath. I love to hear how her work is going -- reconstructing
  events, looking at snapshots, interviewing people, hearing their accurate
  and/or exaggerated recollections. So we talk about Plath and have a diet
  lunch.

  <img src="house_sm61.jpg" border=0 height=300 width=376 align=BOTTOM alt="photo of Nancy Meader by Elsa Dorfman" /></a></center>
</p>
<p>Every couple of months, Nancy and Abbott Meader come down from Oakland,
  Maine, to buy food at the Haymarket, to go to the Museum of Fine Arts or
  the Gardner Museum. We have a regular procedure: Nancy brings supper, usually
  something she has frozen from her garden, like zucchini, or eggplant, a
  lasagna, or something very special like rosemary chicken. We have nibblies:
  beer nuts, peanuts, pickles from the garden, sesame butter. Abbott makes
  a bacon breakfast.</p>
<p>I met Nancy in Paris when we both took our junior year abroad, she from
  the University of Michigan. We roomed together for a few weeks, until she
  met Abbott -- he'd won a grant from Dartmouth to go to Europe to paint.
  Much later, after the birth of her first child when she was twenty-five,
  Nancy started to make pots, Now she is one of the best potters in New England;
  the vase on the table and the coffee mugs in the kitchen photographs are
  hers. Most of the paintings in the kitchen and living room are by Abbott.
  For twelve years, until June 1974, he taught at Colby College; he gave
  it up to see if he and Nancy can support their family totally on their
  work.  </p>

</p>
<p>It's important to me to have close friends like Nancy and Abbott with
  whom I can discuss the ins and outs of marginal living, discuss the problems
  of putting the last dollar on materials or equipment. It takes a sort of
  courage and daring -- at least the conviction/assumption that nothing drastic
  or awful will happen in the next month or two. And then there are the questions
  about getting the work done, the energy drain of teaching, putting together
  a body of work, making it, getting grants, endless subjects to work over.
  The vocabulary is there for us.

<p>Andrea Dworkin, a new friend. We are on a program
  together at Smith College, April 1974. It is the first time either of us
  has made the big-time college lecture scene and we are high from the guest
  star treatment. The women give Andrea a standing ovation when she finishes
  reading the prose piece she'd written for the occasion.</p>
<p>We get through at midnight; there's nothing to do in Northampton, no
  place to go for coffee and talk. No place to celebrate. So she drives with
  me back to Boston. We have a marvelous breakfast; Ilene comes over, and
  so does Charlotte Ibetz, Creeley's daughter. I take a whole roll of film,
  but in my excitement misload the camera. After all these years! 'A moment
  not meant to be preserved, just enjoyed,' I tell them. This is one of three
  images that came out.

</p>
<p>Andy and Christina Wylie moved into the other half of the house, 21
  Flagg Street, in 1970. The three of us had been friends for a long time,
  since Andy's freshman year at Harvard. Christina was pregnant and in August
  1970 Nicholas was born. Andy, who has this demonic energy, would weed the
  backyard every couple of weeks, tearing up the brick patches altogether,
  rather than just pull up the weeds growing in the cracks. Then he would
  lay down a brand-new brick design. I would watch him from my kitchen window,
  going like a dervish. We often ate meals together, drank wine in the evening,
  played with Nicholas, talked about politics, CIA agents, and drug laws.</p>
<p>Andy and I had a theory that the custodian Harvard had hired to look
  after Flagg Street real estate was an informant for the CIA. He would come
  into our houses, allegedly to check for drippy faucets, look in every room
  to size the place up, and ask us ingenuously if we knew where he could
  get some dope. As if we'd fall far such a stupid set-up. He didn't even
  bother to carry a wrench. When something really needed to be repaired,
  he brought his helper who did the actual work.</p>
<p>I took the picture of Andy with a purpose. He had been reading Artaud
  and was convinced I could take an 'Artaud spirit' photograph of him. I
  didn't know what he was talking about, but we went to the side of the house
  and he went through twenty poses. On the roof of my car, on the top of
  the shed where the garbage barrels are kept, against the garage.

<p>Victor Bockris is a friend of Andy Wylie's and like Andy is highly energetic
  and possessed. For a while, he and Andy wrote as a team, Wylie-Bockris,
  specializing in interviews with Mohammed Ali, Salvador Dali, Holly Woodlawn,
  et al.</p>
