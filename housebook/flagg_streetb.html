<p>Gail Gordon has been my friend through thick and thin. She was my roommate
at Jackson and later in New York. We even went to the same elementary school
for a while in Roxbury, Massachusetts, but we didn't find that out until
we met in our college dormitory. The years of trial were after college
when I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was a constant monologue of confusion
and fantasy, and I couldn't keep things together, like arrive places when
I said I would, balance my checkbook, get the laundry done before I totally
ran out of underpants. I had the notion that it was attractive to be suffering,
it was what you were supposed to do if you were at all sensitive. People
didn't just tolerate you when you were down, they loved you for it. [I
don't know whether that idea was part of the fifties or, as John Limon
says, it's an eternal delusion, at least since Rimbaud.) Gail listened
to it all, with close attention but not indulgence. Slowly it dawned on
me that her life was moving, that I'd better do something about my own.

</p><p>The picture of Gail here is from summer 1973. She, Norman, and her two
daughters Deborah and Julie came for several days. It was Julie's sixth
birthday and we put up streamers, had a marvelous chocolate cake. It's
a party. Deborah and Julie decorate my kitchen window shades with Magic
Markers. Paint Styrofoam wig holders. Norman slaves over two old tires,
trying to cut them with a meat knife to make swings out of them. But they're
steel radials, and Norman breaks three different kinds of knife blades,
swears, and won't give up. Finally, finally, they're cut. Then he has to
tape the edges, the interlaced metal is so sharp. We sigh at all-American
persistence.

</p><p>Over the years, Norman has puttered around and fixed all kinds of things
in my house. In his picture here, he's working on the kitchen linoleum.
He built the plant shelf in the living room, as well. When I had my show
in New York City at Focus II, Norman helped Eila with the installation,
following her directions to the quarter-inch. This meant placing nails
carefully with a tape measure, banging them in, hanging the photograph
against the wall, measuring to see that it was even with what was next
to it, almost never the first try, and doing it all over again. While I
frantically pleaded, 'Tell me what to do,' and tried not to get in the
way.

I've known <a href="mazur.jpg">Gail Beckwith
Mazur</a> almost all my life. Our mothers had a friend in common, Sylvia
Tarlin, a woman everyone in Jewish Boston knew and loved. So we saw each
other occasionally and were invited to the same birthday parties. At Newton
High we had several of the same classes and became close friends. We didn't
see each other much in college or the few years after.

</p><p>While I was living on Cambridge Street, I ran into Mildred Beckwith
in Filene's basement and got a rundown on the grandchildren, Danny and
Kathy. When I got home, I called Gail in Providence where she was living
and that was that. We were back in touch.

</p><p>Now she lives in Cambridge and we talk on the telephone every day for
almost an hour. About getting our work done: I must get into the darkroom;
she must sit at her desk and work on her poems. We complain to each other.
Console each other. Cheer each other on. Instead of commiserating on our
mothers, how we can't borrow the car, stay out late, get a new sweater,
now it's Harvey, Mike, Danny, Kathy, our work, And we love to talk about
the people we know; try to figure them out.

</p><p>Though I'm always good for a long phone conversation, I don't have quite
this relationship with anyone else. Gail and I actually see each other
every ten days or so, for a few hours in the afternoon. We're practically
neighbors, so access doesn't explain why we seem to prefer the phone. I
think it's because the phone lets us be personal and thoughtful; there's
a confidentiality that seems impossible face to face. Talking over a distance,
into a machine, can be mesmerizing. It must be why Harvey says most of
the defendants he knows forgot they were being tapped. In the same tape
he'll hear them say, 'I know we're being tapped,' and five minutes later,
'This is how we'll work it.'

  </center>
</p>
<p><a href="ilene_lang.jpg">Ilene Lang</a>
and I are very proud of each other -- because our lives now are so different
from the way they were when we met at Cambridge Computer Associates in
1968. She was a writer of computer user manuals and hired me to edit them
for her. Now she owns two unique and innovative businesses in Harvard Square:
Frameworks [home of do-it-yourself framing] and The Big Picture [instant
posters].

</p><p>We're very involved in each other's work and are sort of a mutual admiration/mutual
support society. Boosters of each other. When I had my show at Boston City
Hall, Ilene helped me set up a darkroom printing schedule for myself and
dry-mounted all the final prints for me. At Harvard Business School she
took a film course and for her major project made a ten-minute movie about
me (called 'At Home, Elsa Dorfman']. Last year, on my birthday, she and
Ed, her husband, did something very special. They found and bought a reliable
second hand car for me. And somehow, because of the way they are, they
made it very easy for me to accept the gift and to enjoy it. [Like a lot
of people, I'm much more comfortable as a giver; presents can, if I'm not
careful, provoke an argument over any obscure issue.)

</p><p>Ilene's second store, The Big Picture, was my idea. I fell in love with
the machine that made the instant posters, making sixty myself the day
I discovered it. 'You have to do something with this machine; it's a gold
mine,' I kept telling her. Every day for a year and a half. Not the least
subtly. Finally, one morning she came over for breakfast and brought almond
croissants. I knew something was up, though the croissants weren't necessarily
the giveaway. 'Guess what,' she said, 'I'm beginning to think you might
have something with that poster machine.' Six months later, she gave me
1 percent of the stock in the corporation and we opened a bottle of Mumm's
champagne.
