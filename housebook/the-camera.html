<center><a href="images/house_lg3.jpg"><img src="house_sm3.jpg" width=452 height=323 border=0 align=bottom alt="Photo of Elsa Dorfman" /></a></center><p>I was <a href="first_self.jpg">twenty-eight</a> when I began to
take pictures. There was little or nothing in my life to suggest that
the camera would be a perfect instrument for my temperament. Except
that I was a starer. I looked at everything and stared at everyone. I
had always wanted to be a writer, but when graduation came, it never
occurred to me, OK, start.</p>
<center>
<a href="images/house_lg4.jpg"><img src="house_sm4.jpg" alt="Myself at home" width=256 height=384 border=0 /></a>
</center>
<p>I went to New York City because in 1959 it wasn't socially
acceptable, for a million reasons, for a girl from Newton to live in
Boston/ Cambridge rather than in her mother and father's house twenty
minutes away. Rather than fight it, Gail Gordon and I moved from
Boston to New York. An employment agency (I had typing, no shorthand)
got me the job at Grove Press. As secretary to the editors, I began
arranging poetry readings for the poets Grove published, Robert
Creeley, Allen Ginsberg, Charles Olson, Robert Duncan, Michael
McClure, Philip Whalen, Denise Levertov, Joel Oppenheimer, Edward
Field. When I moved back to Cambridge, I continued setting up a
poetry circuit, calling myself the Paterson Society, after William
Carlos Williams' major work, Paterson, and for Allen Ginsberg, who
was born there. This activity, which involved sitting on my bed
typing letters to every college in the country, kept me spiritually
alive while I had miscellaneous jobs and later, when I moved to my
parents' house in order to get my master's degree in elementary
education. I lived for the mail. It was my only contact with life: a
card from Corso in Rome, Whalen in San Francisco, Creeley in New
Mexico, McClure. On my twenty-fifth birthday, I happened to get a
note from Allen Ginsberg in Benares, India, and the coincidence
reassured me for weeks.</p>




<p>By the time I began to teach the fifth grade, 1962, it was easy
for the poets I was working with to get readings and it had become a
dreary task for me, so I stopped doing it. But I kept in touch, and
Paul Blackburn, in fact, visited me in school one day and read to the
children -- to the shock of the very straight principal.

<p>After one year in that public school, I ended up at a marvelous
place now called Educational Development Corporation. I had heard
about it and knew I wanted to be there, somehow, and got a job for
the summer of 1963, running the mimeograph machine. For the next two
years, I helped develop teaching materials for elementary school
science teachers. It was George Cope, the photographer who took all
the photographs for the books EDC turned out, who handed me a camera
and showed me how to use it. He was the perfect teacher for me,
making photography seem accessible, not unduly complicated, not very
special. It was June 1965. I think of it as a miracle still.</p>

</center>
<p>As I started to use the camera, my relationship with my Paterson
Society friends began to get its old energy again. My idea of what
these people thought I could do and should do was crucial to me. I
had the notion that they expected something from me -- or at least
they wouldn't be surprised. My fantasy about them helped me approach
the camera with a sense of purpose, seize it and make it an
experiment that worked. Without articulating anything and/or being
heavy-handed, making myself or themselves self-conscious, they took
me as I was presenting myself (though I wasn't necessarily convinced
myself&#93;, seriously, and they expected me to get better at what I
was trying to do. I want to be as scholarly about my camera and
photography as they are about their work. It isn't an accident, I
think, that the body of my work stems from my relationship with these
people -- at least for this time.</p>

</p><p>
In August 1965 I drove to Gloucester to tell Charles Olson what I
was doing. Show him. Take his picture. I knew he'd be glad to see me
getting into something. While we were walking along the beach wall,
he said that if any of my shots of him came out, he'd like to use one
on the cover of The Human Universe, which Grove was about to publish.
It was the first picture I sold, for $25. In 1967, when I'd finally
saved up enough money ($150) for a camera of my own (I'd been
borrowing one from an EDC friend, unbelievable though it seems
now&#93;, I sent a check to Philip Whalen in Kyoto; he and <a href="gary_synder.jpg">Gary
Snyder</a>, who speaks Japanese, bought it for me there and mailed it
to me. And Gordon Cairnie, proprietor of the Grolier Book Shop -- one
of only two people at Harvard who made Bob Creeley feel he might
amount to something &#91;the other, Fred McCreary&#93; -- let me sit
in his store for hours and take pictures of everyone coming and
going/himself.
