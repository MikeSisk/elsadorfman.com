      <p><b><i>What is so amazing about Elsa Dorfman and her large-format Polaroid
          photography is that, in spite of many limitations, she gets such variety.&nbsp;
          The most obvious limitation is of her own choosing--she only does portraits.&nbsp;
          Portraiture has its strictures in that the subject must be at close range.&nbsp;
          The 20x24 Polaroid camera Dorfman uses also imposes restrictions.&nbsp;
          It is very large, heavy, and therefore not portable.&nbsp; All sittings
          must take place in Dorfman's Cambridge studio.&nbsp; Since the camera has
          little depth of field, the backgrounds might as well be simple, and indeed
          they are white.&nbsp; The camera cannot be rototated so the format is always
          vertical.&nbsp; Within these limitations, Dorfman moves freely.</i></b>
              </h3>
      </p>
      <p><b><i>The variety she achieves is a reflection of the nature of this
photographer.&nbsp; She is a no-frills person who is informal, warm, and
humorous. Unlike many photographers' subjects, who resemble long-suffering
dental patients, Dorfman's clients relax, enjoy themselves, and collaborate
at their best.&nbsp; In her own words, she shares insights into her life
and her</i> work.</b>

</p><p>I've always done portraits even as far back as 1965 with black-and-white
35-millimeter film.&nbsp; I don't have a feel for still life and landscape,
maybe a little for table-top clutter.&nbsp; For a very long time, I did
pictures of writers because they were my friends.

</p><p>I started out wanting to be a writer.&nbsp; I graduated from Tufts in
1959.&nbsp; Even though I wanted to be a writer, it never occurred to me
that I could just go off and be a writer. The girls at Tufts were very
smart, maybe smarter than the boys, but none of them were doctors or lawyers.&nbsp;
They all were elementary school teachers, and I was damned if I was going
to be one.

</p><p>I went to New York where I got a job on the <i>Evergreen Review</i>.&nbsp;
I perceived my role there as helping creative men.&nbsp; I arranged the
first poetry readings of the sixties with Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso,
and Jack Kerouac.&nbsp; It was a handmaiden's job, but I considered it
a much more than adequate role in life.

</p><p>It turned out that life in New York was a little too crazy and druggy
for me.&nbsp; I had enough of the middle-class persona not to go for it.&nbsp;
I continued to arrange poetry readings, but I moved back to Boston.&nbsp;
I was really depressed and thought, "What am I going to do now?"

</p><p>In desperation, even embarrassment, I went to Boston College and got
a degree in elementary education--the most ridiculous thing in the world.&nbsp;
I got a job to teach fifth grade in&nbsp; Concord, MA.&nbsp; All my poet
friends came to talk to my class.&nbsp; In 1963, one of the parents said,
"You shouldn't be doing this.&nbsp; I work for a place in Newton called
Education Development Corporation.&nbsp; They really need far-out teachers
like you."

</p><p>She got me a job at EDC; it was a place with an aura of great photography.&nbsp;
Berenice Abbott had been there, and George Cope was there.&nbsp; It was
a place where you could just invent what you wanted to do.&nbsp; I had
time on my hands and asked the photographer to teach me what he was doing.&nbsp;
He did and I loved it.&nbsp; EDC let me borrow a camera, and finally I
had enough money to buy one.&nbsp; That was it.

</p><p>It was ten years of photography, and then I put together<i> Elsa's Housebook--A
Woman's Photojournal,</i> which was published by Godine.&nbsp; Then, six
years later, I started working with this camera.&nbsp; It was very expensive,
and Polaroid wasn't subsidizing me.&nbsp; So,&nbsp; I said to Polaroid,
"What if I got people to hire me and I took their portraits, then I could
afford to fool around with the camera?"&nbsp; They said, "Okay."&nbsp;
So, starting in 1980,&nbsp; I rented it one day a month.&nbsp; It was at
the Museum School.&nbsp; You got the camera and a technician.&nbsp; Ii
would bring my clients to the school.

</p><p>Little by little, more and more people heard about me, and I was able
to rent the camera twice a month.&nbsp; I got to know the people at Polaroid
really well.&nbsp; I kept nagging them by saying, "I could have much more
fun and do much more work if I could rent the camera all the time.'&nbsp;
There are only four of them.&nbsp; My problem was that people would call
me, and I'd have to say, "I'm only shooting on Thursday the 25th from nine
to five.'

</p><p>Finally, I heard that this particular camera was coming back from Japan.
Ii asked for it and finally overcame some of their reservations and got
it.&nbsp; That was two and a half years ago.&nbsp; I rented these two rooms
and the hall in this secure office building.&nbsp; I took out a bank loan
and bought all these lights, and here I am.&nbsp; Now, I can take clients
whenever they want, like Saturdays or Sundays.&nbsp; This is a great space.&nbsp;
It's secreted away with no windows; people feel very private.

</p><p>I am very privileged to have this camera.&nbsp; It's a prototype.&nbsp;
The people who built it are all retired from Polaroid.&nbsp; There ar no
spare parts, and there's only one man who knows how to fix it, Peter Bass.&nbsp;
He's the expert.&nbsp; If it weren't for him, I'd be desperate. Hhe calibrates
it for me. Ii can't seem to do it;&nbsp; I make a mess. It's too exacting.&nbsp;
It's a very magical tool, this camera.&nbsp; Every picture is a miracle
because it was never meant to be a volume machine.

</p><p>I have one set of&nbsp; highly developed muscles that are called portrait
muscles.&nbsp; By the time I've&nbsp; spoken to people on the phone, I
have something to go on.&nbsp; If&nbsp; they don't know my work, I tell
them to go to my shop at Charles Square and see a lot of it.&nbsp; I won't
do anyone who hasn't seen the work.

</p><p>It's really like being a psychic medium.&nbsp; People pass through me
and the camera, and a portrait comes out.&nbsp; I must say, I don't understand
it.&nbsp; It's magical.

</p><p>A lot of the credit goes to my subjects.&nbsp; They are truly marvelous.&nbsp;
They are not only at ease with me, they are comfortable with themselves.&nbsp;
They are not people who feel, "I have too many freckles.&nbsp; My hair
is too curly or too flat." They know I hate coiffure.&nbsp; If they say,
"Oh, you can't touch it up?&nbsp; This isn't for me." I say, "Don't feel
badly."&nbsp; I get the most wonderful people because they are so self-selective
and self-accepting, braces and all.&nbsp; I tell them not to try to coordinate
outfits and colors but just to wear their favorite clothes, T-shirts and
ratty sneakers.&nbsp; I love ratty sneakers.

</p><p>I like to do the whole body, and if the person returns the next year
I'll do the face. Ii like to get establishing shots of the whole family
before I do the children alone.&nbsp; Of course, some people want just
the children.

</p><p>It seems to me that the pictures are all about affection, either for
the person&nbsp; they are going to pose with or the person the photograph
is for.&nbsp; So, people come to commemorate their own relationship or
to make someone else happy.&nbsp; I always try to protect and embrace the
vulnerable person in the group.&nbsp; There's a whole group who come to
celebrate their own survival.&nbsp; I did two families who survived tremendous
car accidents.&nbsp; I find that very moving.

</p><p>Psychologically,&nbsp; I could never do more than eight a month.&nbsp;
It takes a lot out of me. Ii print them, make a copy for myself, and sew
them at the top. They all come in a 23x36-inch plexiglass frame designed
for me by Molly and Van Wood of Small Corp in Greenfield, MA.

</p><p>It is surprising to some people that I limit each sitting to two shots.&nbsp;
I remember the day I decided it.&nbsp; One reason is practical--the film
is very expensive.&nbsp; The other is that I knew I couldn't do it in one
shot.&nbsp; After two shots, they don't get any better, the attention wanes.&nbsp;
And of course with Polaroid, we all get a chance to see it.&nbsp; The subject
has more control than with ordinary photography where you just take one
shot afrter another and don't see the results until a lot later.&nbsp;
The photographer has all the power.&nbsp; With Polaroid, someone may say,
"I don't like my chin that way.&nbsp; I won't do that again."&nbsp; Even
a three-year-old will respond to it and will know he doesn't want to look
like a jerk.

</p><p>People are very naked with me, and I respect that.&nbsp; I am so honored
that they are willing to share with me the affection they have for each
other.

</p><p>I feel like the luckiest person in the world.&nbsp; I have everything
I need or want and more than I expected.&nbsp; I have a nice gallery in
New York, Brent Sikkema; he used to be in Boston.&nbsp; I apply for grants
and usually don't get them, but I got one when I really needed it.&nbsp;
I got a Bunting Fellowship in 1972 when I was desperate and couldn't pay
my rent.&nbsp; I had it for two years. It was incredible.&nbsp; I'll always
be grateful to the Bunting Institute.&nbsp; Now, a grant would be terrific
because I'd like to do a book, but that's a different level of need.&nbsp;
I'll have a book eventually.&nbsp; I'm doing everything I applied for grants
for and didn't get.&nbsp; That's good fortune.&nbsp;&nbsp;
