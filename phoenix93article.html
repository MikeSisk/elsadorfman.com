<ul><i>Other portrait photographers try to capture people's souls.&nbsp;
I'm not interested in capturing anybody's soul.&nbsp; People are so complicated,
how are you going to decide what's the definitive moment?...If I took a
picture of Mick Jagger and his family, it would look like all my other
pictures.</i></ul>
Unoconventional portrait photographer Elsa Dorfman suffers a conventional
life as only an innocently eccentric Cantabrigian can.&nbsp; She lives
on a surprisingly peaceful street near Harvard Square with her husband,
liberal attorney (and Phoenix contributor) Harvey Silverglate, and their
teenage son, Isaac, in a house that was formerly an SDS headquarters.&nbsp;
Like every city dweller's, her trash gets pillaged. And since she knows
the refuse from her converted-garage framing studio has intriguing potential
for reuse, she puts the good stuff out conspicuoulsly so the neighbors
can browse.

<ul><i>There's a long tradiition of women portrait photographers, but I'm
not like anybody else.&nbsp; I would say, I'm probably sui generis.&nbsp;
There are only about 10 people doing portraiture on the 29-by-24 camera,
and mine are the humorous.&nbsp; Mine are the most classical, the most
simple, the most forgiving.&nbsp; I'm a healing photographer.&nbsp; I don't
have a cynical or ironic eye.</i></ul>
Dorfman takes peoples pictures for hire in her basement studio at 955 Mass
Ave. in Cambridge, but what she does should never be confused with the
Bachrach or Sears genres, though, as with many commercial studio portraitists,
there is an element of routine to her work.&nbsp; Every portrait she takes
is the same size (23x36') and every subject (single, couple, or group)
is shot in front of the same white background.&nbsp; But her one-hour portrait
sessions are unorthodox, to say the least.&nbsp; Her clients (she does
about 100 sessions a year) are encouraged to dress casually and to bring
props--tools, paintings, sporting equipment, fetishes, pets, even whiskey
bottles.&nbsp; Dorfman, herself a master of informality,&nbsp; wears an
apron and confronts her subjects in her stocking feet.&nbsp; Unlike most
portrait photographers, who cover their bets by taking a dozen sshots and
then letting the client pick from proofs, she makes only two exposures
on large-format Polaroid color film (one of which the client keeps). Nothing,
she claims, ever gets any better after the first two exposures, and besides,
the big film is expensive.&nbsp; (Dorfman's sessions aren't cheap, but
if somebody blinks or if there is tecnical problem, she'll reshoot---no
extra charge).&nbsp; In full-figure poses her subjects emerge, on the spot,
roughly a foot and a half high.&nbsp; Working close-up, head-and-shoulder
portraits can be life-size or better.

<p>Central to her sessions, of course, is sharing and critiquing the instant
result of the first one-of-a-kind print.&nbsp; "I don't really direct my
clients, " she says.&nbsp; "I correct.&nbsp; I don't interpret my subjects.&nbsp;
They interpret themselves....It's amazing how well it works, especially
with kids.&nbsp; Thanks to MTV and advertising, everbyody knows how to
pose these days."

<p>Her 20-by-24 camera, which she's rented from Polaroid since 1987, is
one of five prototype large
<br>format instant-photograpny rigs hand-built in the Polaroid labs.&nbsp;
All the engineers who crafted it have retired.&nbsp; There are no replacement
parts.&nbsp; The giant camera was designed by Polaroid founder Dr. Edwin
Land himself and was inted to be used as a copy camera to make one-to-one
reproductions of painting and other works of art.&nbsp; (An even larger
one-of-a-kind walk-in Polaroid camera was installed at the Museum of Fine
Arts for years.&nbsp; It could produce a life-size image of an entire tapestry.)

<p>Through the late '70s and early '80s, Polaroid aggressively supported
fine-art photography by encouraging gallery photographers to use and experiment
with its film and cameras.&nbsp; In 1980 Dormfman tried the 20-by-24, then
housed at the Museum School, and never looked back.&nbsp; She began renting
time on that camera for personal projects and for commissioned portraits.&nbsp;
In 1987, she persuaded Polaroid to lease her the only afvailable 20-by-24
(which had previously been installed in Japan) and opened her studio.

<p>The large-format Polaroid medium is an intrinisic part of Dorfman's
style and presentation.&nbsp; Unlike the more familiar "develop while you
watch" Polaroid films for the companys Spectrum and OneStep consumer cameras,
the 20-by-24 eats giant rolls of film stock that work on the older "peel-apart"
instant photography technolgoy.&nbsp; This involves sandwiching developing
chemicals between the film's negative (on which the picture is taken) and
the photo paper that will hold the final image.&nbsp; Then the developmen
time's up (70 seconds), you peel the postive and negative sheets apart
and throw the negative away.&nbsp; It is useless and turns black in about
fifteen minutes.

<p>In the process, some of the chemicals get smeared around the margins,
rendering the borders of the finished print rough and discolored.&nbsp;
Although it would be neater to trim the print or cover the streaky blotches
with a matte, Dormfman prefers framing the entire sheet of film---borders
exposed.&nbsp; And she signs, dates, and captions every portrait in her
trademark India-ink scrawl across the bottom.&nbsp; It's a distincitve
format; ther is no mistaking Dorfman's handiwork.&nbsp; She copies every
Polaroid portrait onto conventional four-by-five color film so clients
can order reprints.

<ul><i>There were 80 women in my college graduating class.&nbsp; One went
to med school, two went to law school, and the rest became teachers or
secretaries...The girdle that was put on women in the '50s is very hard
to explain to women now.&nbsp; Breaking out of it was more painful than
groovy.</i></ul>
Dorfman is a comfrortale fit with the 02139 mystique, dividing her time
between her art and her family, her work and h er home.&nbsp; In a city
cluttered with poets and thinkers, a life that sets its own pace in the
name of creativity is no anomaly.&nbsp; But amid the surrounding real and
postured bohemianism, Elsa Dorfman, now in her early 50s, is perhaps more
of a genuine article.&nbsp; Her credentials date back to 1959, when, after
being graduated from Tufts, she opted to forsake her assumed schoolteacher
destiny and headed for New York.&nbsp; There she found a&nbsp; job as secretary
to Evergreen Review managing editor Richard Seaver at Grove Press.&nbsp;
Soon she was setting up poetry readings at colleges across the country
for such Beat luminaries as Allen Ginsberg, Robert Creeley, Jack Kerouac,
and Charles Olson.

<p>That lasted about a year, after which the druggy Village ambiance got
to Dorfman, and she scurried back to Boston, got a teaching degree from
BC, and taught elementary school in Concord.&nbsp; After a few years of
trying to jusfify her two worlds by reading Ginsberg haiku to fifth graders,
Dorfman hooked up with the Educational development Corporation, a progressive
teaching think tank in Newton where she learned and obsessed on, photography.

<p>For years, she photographed her friends, sometimes providing underground
celebrity portraits to decorate the Grolier Book Shop and dust jacket shots
for poetry anthologies with exceptionally short press runs.&nbsp; Many
of her black and white 35mm portraits were shot in the living room of her
Flagg Street duplex (which turned into a sort of perpetual crash pad for
visiting impoverished poets), each of her subjects draped over the same
Victorian monstrosity of a couch.&nbsp; ("We still have it.&nbsp; It's
our living-room furniture.")

<p>Whether Dorfman fully realizes it or not, the concept, a parade of drop-ins
snapped in a consistent setting--different faces visiting the same space--is
clearly mirrored in her current portraiture format.&nbsp; Once subjects
lolled on Moby Couch; now they pose on her generic timeless/placeless studio
set.&nbsp; Likewise, her decades-old habit of returning to the same subject
from time to time persists.&nbsp; (Allen Ginsberg is documented regularly;
so are members of Isaac's grade-school classes, and more than one return
portrait customer has been photographed holding an earlier Dorfman study.)&nbsp;
And she's still dedicated to turning her camera on her family and friends.

<p>In&nbsp; 1972, Dorfman entered the pantheon of unforgettable Cambridge
charcters by hawking her prints from Columbus Day to Christmas out of a
supermarket shopping cart at the Holyoke Center.&nbsp; The Cambridge cops,
of course, hassled her, along with all the unlicensed sidewalk sandal vendors,
but then-boyfriend Silverglate convinced the authorities that photo sales
were protected under the First Amendment, and for a few seasons, Elsa's
photo concession was an expected Harvard Square holiday tradition.

<p>Two years later, David R. Godine published Dorfman's annotated collection
of personal photographs, <i>Elsa's Housebook--A Woman's Photojournal</i>,
which featured informal portaraits (shot in conventional black and white)
of house guests Ginsberg, Creeley, Lawrtence Ferlinghetti, Peter Orlovsky,
and Robert Bly, mixed in with shots of family and less-famous scruffy folke.&nbsp;
(The couch played a major supporing role.)

<ul><i>I don't take a critical look at anybody.&nbsp; Life is hard enough.&nbsp;
I don't want to take pictures that capitalize on somebody's pain...People
can stand in front of my camera and know that I won't take advantage of
them...There's an element of trust with my clients.&nbsp; They're trusting
me that I'm not going to make them look like an asshole.</i></ul>
Elsa Dorfman does not attract a traditional portrait-studio clientele.&nbsp;
Her subjects, all of whom have seen her work, find her by word of mouth,
and everyone who sits for her, she claims, is no more than two people away
from someone she's already photographed.&nbsp; It's like an extended family,
and in two shots she manages to caputre graceful, coherent, and convincing
images of people of all ages and backgrounds--no clumsiness, no awkward
postures, no obvious nervousness--even in groups.&nbsp; As any photographer
knows, that's the result of something more than just knowing when to trip
the shutter.&nbsp; It comes down to relating to your subjects and putting
them, and yourself, at ease.

<p>How does Dorfman manage this?&nbsp; "As Jack Kerouac said to me once,
' I just do it.' It's not my job to explain what I do." she says.&nbsp;
But that's too facile an answer even for a modest photo artist.&nbsp; Proceeded
to explain further, Dorfman ends up sounding like the Mr. Rogers of portraiture--the
antithesis of such cruel-and-critical super-analytical portraitists as,
say, Diane Arbus, for whom every subject was an object of exploitation
for comment.&nbsp; "I create an atmosphere that says it's okay to be the
way you are.&nbsp; I project approval.&nbsp; I'm very open with my subjects,&nbsp;
and that's easy because the people who come to me are already open, un-uptight
people, or they wouldn't choose me....My hardest subjects are anorexic,
overachieving women.&nbsp; They're so tough on themselves that I'm exhausted
when I'm done.&nbsp; You can't embrace them.&nbsp; There is no comfort
zone with a person like that."

<p>Still there must be something more to Dorfman's lucidity within what
is perhaps the most fragile and demanding of photography's schools.&nbsp;
Perhaps it is precisely because she doesn't try to probe beneath her subjects'
skins that she ends up revealing their best sides.&nbsp; When she says
she's "open," Dorfman seems to mean friendly and accepting, not touchy-feely/mindmelding.&nbsp;
"I've been overwhelmed by all the openness I was exposed to in the '60s,"
she explains.&nbsp; "I was stuck in so many rooms....what were they?....encounter
groups, that I got to the point that I wanted to tell people, 'Just leave
your psychological clothing on!' "

<p>And, for the most part, they do.&nbsp; Dorfman's technically exquisite
portraits are attractive and esygoing.&nbsp; Seldom is there much to challenge
the imagination.&nbsp; Almost never do you suspect that the faces she's
captured are letting you peek at any secrets or betraying any guarded hypocricies.&nbsp;
But there are a few hidden agendas.&nbsp; Though Dorfman is reluctant to
write or tell personal stories out of respect for her clients' confidentiality,
she often sees more than she photographs.&nbsp; "I'm very attuned to people
around me.. That's common to portrait photographers, and it takes a lot
of psychic energy.&nbsp; I can spot the vulnerable members of a family--sense
tensions in a group.&nbsp; But I don't try to show that in my portraits."

<p>Clients make appointments with Dorfman for all the predictable photo-commemorative
reasons-birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, weddings, and so on.&nbsp;
Some show up every so many years just to document how the kids have grown.&nbsp;
("I hate it when my families get divorced,' Dorfman complains.)&nbsp; But
sometimes, there are more somber motives; motives that speak to the illusion
of immortality that photography (perhaps especially large-format photography)
offers; motives that, Dorfman speculates, relate somehow to the 19th century
customs of "coffin photography" and sentimental potraits of mothers cradling
dead infants; motives that remind us of the power and psychology of photographs.
People diagnosed with fatal diseases want to stand for portraits before
their illness advances visibly.&nbsp; Even stranger-seeming, Dorfman notes
familes that have commissioned group portraits on the anniversary of a
tragic loss&nbsp; "There must be an impulse to document the healing," she
says.&nbsp; "Not to commemorate someone's death, but to commemorate that
you've survived the event and that you're whole again."

<ul><i>Since I did the Housebook, my life has narrowed and my work has
narrowed.&nbsp; The 20-by-24 is very narrow.&nbsp; My portraits could be
seen as variations on the same theme.</i></ul>
Time and again, when asked to characterize her work, Dorfman points out
that the variety in her portraits has to be found in the subjects, not
the setting. She takes the same approach&nbsp; to her personal projects
-- photographing&nbsp; Isaac's class or even a logistically nightmarish
20-by-24 location shoot at the Big Apple Circus--as she does to her commissions.&nbsp;
and client-to-client, the white no-seam backgdrop looks pretty much the
same.&nbsp; (One suspects Dorfman intended the props with which her subjects
are encouraged pose to be a stronger individualizing absurdist element
than they sually are.&nbsp; The props are only occasionally involving or
funny; too often they end up being just cute.)&nbsp; The visual uniformity
of her shots unintentionally transforms the entire body of Dorfman's portraiture
into a piece of conceptual art--akin to hiding a camera on a Green Line
car and photographing everyone who sat in a given seat for a decade.

<p>Rummaging through Dorfman's back files, though, it's surpsing to see
that her thoroughly consistent light touch actually evolved out of something
more varied.&nbsp; Compared to recent pictures, the 20j-by-24 portraits
Dorfman took in 1984-85 (before she had her own studio) are immediately
recognizable as photo-art--the subject's identity isn't necessarily more
important than the lighting, composition, or attitude--all of which in
Dorfman's older examples are far from standard.&nbsp; The critic in me
sees more experimentation in the old stuff.&nbsp; And preers it.&nbsp;
You don't have to be in these photos to appreciate them.&nbsp; They work
on two levels--as photos and as portraits.&nbsp; There are implied messages
that may have nothing to do with the models as individuals.

<p>Dorfman herself doesn't see it that way, noting only that she used to
vary the distance to her subjects more and commenting, "My first black
and white work was grimmer.&nbsp; The old 20-by-24 portraits weren't as
playful.&nbsp; My work lightened up when I got my own studio."

<p>Clearly, Dorfman prefers where her work is today--client-specific, client-pleasing,
almost minimal, and unpretentious.&nbsp; "Sometimes, you have a portrait
that works as an icon, " she says.&nbsp; "A father and two sons, all in
hockey uniforms--that's iconic; that'll work for anyone.&nbsp; but by the
year 2050, my pictures of families from Newton will be iconic, too."

<p>And indeed, today's Uncle Louis will be tomorrow's proto-90's stereotype,
just as all those unremarkable-in-their-day highschol yearbook portraits
have come to speak for the '40s, '50s, and other decades.&nbsp; Except
that Dorfman's portraits have the advantage of being remarkable in their
own time as well.&nbsp; And the fact that her subjects are undoctored by
dress codes or stage directions is going to make Dorfman's collective societal
portrait all the more accurate and valuable to the future generation that
"rediscovers" it.&nbsp; So what if some of the subjects are holding poodles
or barbells? Our posterity hs a right to see us, foibles and all.
