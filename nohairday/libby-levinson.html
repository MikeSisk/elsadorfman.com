<p>
<span class="quotestarter">I'm Libby Levinson and on November 5, 1997,
I got the good news that I had breast cancer.</span>  I had had a
routine mammogram and some calcifications were discovered on the
mammogram, on my left breast. My gynecologist recommended that I see a
breast surgeon, who recommended a biopsy, and I got the results of the
biopsy on November 5, that I had breast cancer.
</p>

<p>
It was a very grave day. I was convinced that I didn't have breast
cancer. I was reassuring the surgeon the day of the biopsy, not to
worry about me, that I was fine, that my biopsy was going to be
negative. I was trying to believe that, thinking that if I really, really held
tight to that belief, that I wouldn't have breast cancer.
</p>

<p>
The next step was to revisit the surgeon and to discuss with him what
my options were, whether to have a lumpectomy or a mastectomy, whether
to have reconstruction with a mastectomy, whether to have bilateral
mastectomy or just the mastectomy on the left side. I opted for the
mastectomy and not the lumpectomy because there were actually two
sites in the breast, two locations where they found calcifications.
</p>

<p>
Only one location had been biopsied, and of course it was positive for
cancer. So I was convinced that the other location would also be
cancer, and I just opted to have the breast removed rather than going
and having another biopsy and having to wait another couple of days to
find out whether in fact it was cancer. I couldn't live with that. I
just wanted the breast off. I made up my mind right then and there in
the surgeon's office. My husband was with me; my sister was with
me. They were both very supportive of my decision, and I was anxious
to move forward with my surgery. 
</p>

<p>
The surgeon insisted that I visit a plastic surgeon to learn
about reconstructive surgery and then to make my decision
as to whether I wanted it. I knew I didn't want reconstructive surgery.
I just wanted to have the breast removed.
</p>
<p>
I met Debbie Dorsey at a breast cancer support group. It was exactly a
week before I was scheduled to start chemotherapy. I came into the
group very frightened, not knowing what to expect, not knowing what
the women were going to look like, how they were going to feel. I
came, sat down, and burst into tears.  I introduced myself once I got
my composure. I learned that there was one other woman in the group
who was exactly a week before her first chemotherapy treatment and had
all the same fears and concerns that I had, and that was Debbie.
</p>
<p>
Debbie and I bonded at that point. I remember she called me that night
and we talked about the group. We talked about how much better we felt
after having been with the group and being with the women who were
having the same treatment that we were going to have and seeing that
they were actually okay.  Some of them were even still working.
</p>
<p>
Our treatments were pretty much simultaneous.  We finished on exactly
the same day, February 19th.  Actually Debbie's first treatment was a
few days before mine. She called me as soon as she got home, and she
said to me, Libby, it's doable.
</p><p>

So Debbie was somebody to joke with, even though the humor was kind of
sick. We had our own little vocabulary of chemo words that we used,
chemo breast and chemo mouth and chemo farts, and we talked about all
the reasons why it was good not to have hair and how much money we
were saving on shampoos and haircuts and how easy it was in the
morning to get ready. We did a lot of laughing together, something
that I couldn't do with most anybody else because most everybody else
was pretty much horrified about the cancer and the treatments, but
with Debbie I just let my hair down and we just made humor in what we
were going through.  We let our hair down.

</p><p>

Then through Debbie I met Carol. Carol was in the hospital with
neutropenia, which is often a result of chemotherapy.  I was admitted
to the hospital because I had neutropenia.  Debbie of course knew that
Carol was in the hospital and called her on the phone and said,
Libby's being admitted.  I had never met Carol and I was in my
hospital room, scared to death of what was happening to me, thinking
that I was probably going to die because I had no white cells to fight
off this infection that I had. There was a knock at the door, and a
person came in with no hair, a bald person and a mask, and this is how
I met Carol.  She'd left the floor that she was on and she took the
elevator and came down and found my room and came in to introduce
herself. She immediately assuaged all of my fears and told me about
what it was like and how she felt, and she was actually leaving the
hospital that same night and going to Hawaii the next day. I thought,
I guess I'm going to be okay after all.

<p>

Debbie was the one who connected us with Elsa. Debbie called us and
said, How do you feel about having your portrait done? A photo
portrait with no hair. Bald. And I thought, Yeah, that sounds pretty
good. It was very difficult. I was very self-conscious of having no
hair. I did not enjoy having no hair. I wore my wig faithfully every
day to work. I was never seen in public without my wig. The only time
I didn't wear my wig was when I went to chemotherapy, because why
should I wear my wig to chemotherapy?

</p><p>

When Deb first asked me if I'd be interested in having a photograph
taken of myself or having photographs taken without my hair, a
portrait of a bald woman going through chemotherapy, my first reaction was,
yeah, I guess so, why not? And the more I thought about it, the more I
thought it would be symbolic for me because no one outside of my
immediate family ever saw me without my wig or a hat. My head was
always covered.  My friends at work, the people that I would see on
the street all looked at me like I was just, you know, another
person. But the real me, the real person was a bald woman who had lost
her hair because of chemotherapy.  And I thought, yeah, I want to do
this. I want the world to see how I am. It may not be socially
acceptable for me to take my wig off at work, but this is the real
me. And so I agreed to do it.

</p><p>

The three of us cooked up chemo-chic. Chemo-chic was going to
chemotherapy looking chic. What we did was, we would buy beautiful
scarves and tie them around our heads and then don a cap, a baseball
cap or a hat, or something over the scarf, and look really cool and
have an attitude. It was the chemo-chic attitude. And this is how I
went for my chemotherapy every time and we laughed, the three of us,
about chemo-chic.

</p><p>

I kind of felt that, well, through photography, through the
photographs, we were being immortalized. And if we were lucky and we
made it, fine, we had the moment captured on a photograph. And if we
didn't make it, if we weren't lucky, there we were, captured in Elsa's
photographs.

</p><p>

I try to encourage women who are newly diagnosed with cancer to join a
support group and be with other women who are going through exactly
what they're going through. Because there is nobody else who
understands what it's like, how you feel, what your fears are. There's
nobody else who understands why the first thing you think of when you
wake up in the morning is, am I going to die?  Am I going to be okay?
And the last thing you think about before you go to sleep, am I going
to die, am I going to be okay ?

<p>

<span class="redquotee">Libby</span> Each time I went to the hospital
for my treatment or if it was for a doctor's appointment, I would
identify myself as my Beth Israel Hospital number or my Social
Security number. They're not interested in your name. They want to
know your number so that they make sure that they give the medication
to the right number.  I was very solemn in this picture because I felt
that I wasn't a person. I was a number being treated for breast
cancer. A statistic.

</p><p>

<span class="redquotee">Elsa</span> Libby really wanted me take a
picture of her holding a card with a number. She even brought
cardboard and magic markers to my studio, along with an ugly hospital
johnny, so she could draw a big number. She wanted to hold her number
right across her chest.  Number: I could only think of a prisoner's
number or a concentration camp person's tattooed number. I couldn't
get past it.

</p><p>

Luckily the hospital identity card was nothing to look at. Carol
emptied all her charge cards. There was her drivers license. How
about using that? Libby pulled out her license and so did Debbie.
They looked at the pictures of themselves BEFORE the cancer. They
really did look different.

</p><p>

<span class="redquotee">Libby</span> We held up our driver's licenses,
which is kind of odd because on our driver's licenses we all have
hair. In the portrait we're all women with no hair and we are holding
up photos of ourselves with hair. But the driver's license is an
identity card.
