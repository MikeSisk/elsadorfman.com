Elsa Dorfman is a portrait photographer and writer from
Cambridge, MA. Her portraits of poets, writers and other
friends were published in <em>Elsa's Housebook: A Woman's
Photojournal</em> (Godine, 1974). She collaborated with Robert
Creeley on the books <em>En Famille</em> (Granary Press, 1999) and
<em>His Idea</em> (Coach House Press, 1975).

Bob Burns has been producing and directing science, public
affairs, and educational documentaries for more than twenty
years. No Hair Day marked a return to Bob's video roots---the
very personal and experimental video art of the 1970s. Bob
liked the 70s better.

Katy Homans did more than design this book. She took it
under her wing and made magic. A couple of hundred books
have been informed by her generous eye and her inscrutable
taste. She has no favorites. She lives in Manhattan with her
husband Patterson Sims and their daughters Mardet and Lally.
We have been friends since 1973.

national PBS series, "Independent Focus." A VHS copy can be purchased

The film and the Polaroid 20 x 24 original portraits were exhibited
at the DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park, Lincoln,
MA in 2000. The show was curated by George Fifield and had
two godmothers, curator Rachel Rosenfield Lafo and overseer
Susan Master-Karnik. Replica portraits and film were exhibited
at Cape Cod Community College and the Houston Center for
Photography in 2001. A portfolio of portraits was printed in
<em>Hanging Loose</em> 80 and <em>Journal of the Hippocratic Society</em> (Vol.2).

Carol Potoff died on November 28, 2001. An artist who worked
in many media including yarn, she was a beloved art teacher
at Nauset Regional High School in North Eastham, MA. She
called her friends Darling and her cat Baby. Her alter ego was
Miss Lulu, a seventy-year-old woman. Purple was her favorite
color. In her school studio she had a phone that she called "a
phone to God." She would say to students, if you have that big
a problem, you can always call God. Then she would pick up
the phone and say Hello God? Are you there?

work includes essays on Mathew Brady, Lewis Hine, and
H.C. Anderson.

Patty Curran was born in south Georgia in 1945. She has lived in Pensacola 
& Jacksonville (FL),Wilmington (DE),Portsmouth (&Newport News (VA) New 
London (CN) POrtland & Kittery (ME) Chicago & Lake Bluff (IL) Quinsette 
Point & Wilford (RI) Lorraine  & Sheffield Lake & Cleveland (OH), Cape Cod 
(MA) for ten years and the same neighborhood in Cambridge (MA) for the last 
24 years.  This variety seems to have jarred her out of a rut for 
life.  Growing up, she found her parents the basis for what she does and 
who she is.  Her father' had a  near pathologic attention to detail and her 
mother' cd make something beautiful w/ her worldclass sewing out of 
anything.  And her mom wd never tolerate any i can't do it negativity. Her 
answer to everything was, do it any which way.  All of this gave Patty a  a 
diverse assortment of talents and gave her  the permission to be 
adventurous. She never felt she had to specialize. Besides sewing 
everything from draperies to costumes to fur coats for little dogs, Elsa's dresses, vests and purse and Harvey's ties, she has made lingerie 
for Cambridge's mythic HubbaHubba shop, cartoons and street graffitti, 
murals for Herrell's Ice Cream in Harvard Square, Daddy-Os in East 
Cambridge, Out of the Blue in Davis Square and the Wine Tasting Room in 
Ball Square, and animation drawing. Since 1989 she has done a lot of 
antique restoration for very fussy antique dealers.  On top of all this, 
she is known to make wonderful paintings.

     Nancy was born in Washington D.C. in 1947 and grew up  in its 
suburbs, waiting out the fifties until something better came along -- 
the sixties. During that decade she went to college in various places 
and eventually got a degree from Hebrew University in Jerusalem in art 
history which she never imagined would give her a marketable skill. 
About twenty years later, she left teaching
to study landscape design at Radclliffe Seminars.   This program and her art
history background gave her the training  that complemented her lifelong love
of gardening and the outdoors.  She has run her own landscape design/build
business since 1985.
</p><p>
     In February 2003 she found out she had breast cancer.  She had a
lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation; she finished her treatments in 
August 2003.
She was able to remain fairly cheerful and keep her business going throughout
this period (and beyond) with the support  of her family, friends and great
landscape crew as well as the patience and understanding of her clients.  She
would like to thank all of them for helping her get through this past 
year. Her friend Ginny
Remedi   made the earrings that she is wearing in the photos.   Ginny's
