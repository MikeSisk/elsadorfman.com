<span class="quotestarter">I'm an artist and an art
teacher.</span> Libby was saying she felt like a number, and I said I
feel more like a number now than I did in treatment.  Then people
would greet me, you know, I came to know people. They told me I look
nice or something. Now I just feel like, well, did it, been there, did
my treatment, done with the treatment, no big deal now, you know.  I
look normal now. It's kind of like, well, I had cancer, it's gone.

</p><p>

Now I feel like a statistic. Well, in 1997, 165,000 women were
diagnosed with breast cancer, one of whom was me. Now I'm waiting to
see what they say in 2002. Am I going to be one of the 35,000 who
survives?

</p><p>

I feel much more anonymous and inconspicuous now than I did during
treatment, especially because everybody was revolving around me during
treatment. Now no one asks what it's like to wake up every day and go,
oh, Jesus, am I okay today? What's wrong today? People don't want to
know I'm still sick. I look normal.  I look fine. Well, I looked great
before I had cancer. You couldn't tell by looking at me that I was
sick. I just want the fear to be done so that I can really be normal.

</p><p>

I go once every three months to my oncologist. I see my plastic
surgeon every six months. I see my radiologist every six months. I see
my breast surgeon every six months. We stagger the appointments. I'm
probably going up to Boston to see my doctors once every month, month
and a half.

</p><p>

Where do I go from here with my life? Well, here's the problem. For a
while I did live my life differently, and then I wake up and find that
I'm in the same routine. I've gotten back into the flow of school and
the same kind of frenetic pace, and I don't rest the same way that I
had been, etc. The difference is now at least I'll stop myself and
say, whoa, where are you going? Come back, come back, take care of
yourself, relax. So that's good.

</p><p>

I don't know if I'll stay in teaching. I question more. What do I want
to do?  Life is short, so every day I think about that and as I'm
going to school, I think ooh, better have fun, because who knows? Who
knows what will happen tomorrow?

</p><p>

It's frustrating now because my health is not the same. I have more
allergies now.  I'm still having trouble with my bionic boob. It's a
little larger than the other one, so there's a little jealousy
reigning on my chest. So I have to take care of that. You know, muscle
problems back here. It feels like my bra is too tight. So that stuff
is what I have to deal with at this point in time. But I know I want
to make life changes. I think I'm going to go to France for a year and
live there and just do things. I don't put things off the same way I
used to.

</p><p>

What would be the one thing I would tell another woman who was newly
diagnosed with breast cancer? Actually I'd have to tell her two or
three things. First off, there is life after the diagnosis and the
cancer, and things get easier once she makes a decision on
treatment. And the other thing I would tell her is, talk to as many
people as possible who have had the treatments that she's
considering. The reconstruction, the flap, an epidural, cytoxin,
adriamycin, 5FU, the drugs they give you to take. Talk to as many
women as possible who have gone through the process. I did talk to
some people about certain parts of the procedure and not about others.
Had I talked to more people, I might have changed my decisions. And
I'd tell them that there's still fun out here on the other side.

</p><p>

Why did I get cancer? Maybe I drank too much diet soda when I was a
kid.  I drank it by the gallon. Maybe it runs in my family. My mother
died of breast cancer. My aunts, her sisters, both had breast
cancer. Maybe I'm living in a toxic waste dump. Maybe I had the wrong
attitude. I was depressed. Maybe that contributed to it. Maybe the
universe is trying to tell me something. I don't know. I thought I
would be cured if I ate macrobiotics, but now I realize that the
biscotti and cookies and the Ben and Jerry's might be just the thing
to save me.

<span class="redquotee">Elsa</span> Carol never wore a wig, or at
least she never took the price tags off the wigs she bought. Being an
artist with a great flair for fashion, she found unusual fabrics and
made herself turbans.  Originally she learned to make the turbans from
a videotape at Beth Israel Hospital. But of course she took off from
the video and made the turbans her own.

</p><p>

<span class="quotee">Carol</span> <span class="bluequote">Losing your
hair seems traumatic, but there can be some fun and wonderfully close
moments. The first time I lost my hair to chemo (it's been twice now),
I was freaked. I actually was in the hospital at the time and it
started falling out in the shower. I called Audrey Greenway to bring
the buzzer, and we had a hair-cutting party. Janie Matlaw took
pictures.</span>

</p><p>

<span class="bluequote">I tried the wig route. Well, actually, Janie,
Audrey, and I went to try them on. I was a blonde for a few minutes,
and then a redhead with the long straight locks I had always
wanted. Then there were the cornrows. The blonde wig didn't suit me as
well as I had hoped. I looked like Patrick Swayze in <a
href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0114682">To Wong Foo</a>. I had to
agree that my natural hair color looked much more suited to me. I
didn't end up buying a wig.</span>

</p><p>

<span class="bluequote">I preferred wearing turbans, which I tied
using several scarves together. It was fun combining patterns and even
putting on a pin, too. The Dana Farber has a video called "Scarves" in
their lending library. I watched it with Audrey and we both wrapped
ourselves in scarves that we got at Marshall's and Goodwill, trying
out the different techniques.</span>

</p><p>

<span class="bluequote">I have to tell you that most days I felt quite
exotic and lovely when I had my turban on. I became a hat-wearer,
which I hadn't been. Again, great fun to try them on with a friend and
laugh and carry on. Libby and I toured the cosmetic department looking
for just the right purple eyeliner.  Did I get creative with
that!</span>

</p><p>

<span class="bluequote">The second time I lost my hair it was much
less traumatic. I didn't feel much like wearing anything on my head. I
teach art at a high school and before my hair fell out I dyed it
fuschia. My students told me what kind of dyes, bleach, etc. to use,
and how. Then when it started to go, a colleague at school, Jody
Craven, buzzed it for me. Because many of the boys wear their hair
buzzed down to the scalp, I felt pretty comfortable having my bald
head uncovered, at first at school and then more and more in
public. To my eyes, the world looked the same. One day at the
supermarket, a woman gave me thumbs up when she saw me without any
headgear.</span>
