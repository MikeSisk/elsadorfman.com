<p>
<span class="quotestarter">I was completely freaked
out when my hair grew
back curly.</span> I couldn't believe
it. I had very long, dark,
straight hair. It had maybe a
little bit of curl but it grew
back and it's continuing to be
very, very curly, which is really
kind of ironic because when
I was a little girl, that's all I
dreamed of, having long, curly
hair.
</p><p>
When my hair started growing
back and it was growing back
curly, I met some woman on
the street and she said, Oh!
I love your hair! Where did you
get it done? And I said, Oh,
I got it done at Dana Farber
Cancer Institute. So I kind of
shocked her, and I apologized:
Sorry, I didn't mean to say
that, but it was pretty funny,
your asking me like that.
</p><p>
On October 23, 1997 I was
diagnosed with breast cancer.
It was pretty dramatic and
traumatic and pretty devastating, and it changed my
life a lot.
</p><p>
I don't know why, but when
I was younger, I always wondered how a doctor would tell
somebody that they had cancer. Would they come in and
say you have cancer, or oh,
I'm sorry, you have cancer, or
would they come in and say
oh, no, things aren't too good,
it's not good.
</p><p>
When I was told, it was after
a biopsy. I had been told by
two breast surgeons that it
did not look like cancer, that
it was not cancer, that it was
this lump in my right breast,
but I should get it out
because who wants a lump
in their right breast? So, I
went into the hospital and
had a biopsy. During the
biopsy, the surgeon said, Oh,
this looks good, this looks
great. I wasn't stressed
because I wasn't worried
about anything. I thought this
was nothing, I was going to
be fine. I was actually talking
to one of the nurses about
a facelift, like, would I ever get
one some day. She had just
had a beautiful facelift.
</p><p>
I went into the recovery room
and sat there for a while talking to all the other patients
and asking what their diseases
or ailments were. Then a
nurse came in and said, the
doctor wants to see you, and
I said, is everything okay? She
said oh, yeah. I said okay.
</p><p>
So, I went into this tiny, excruciatingly tiny room. There was
my Bob. I looked at him and
I said, It seemed like it went
fine. Do you know anything?
He said, No. All of a sudden
the door opened and Barbara
Smith, who is my surgeon, she
just kind of like bent down and
she said, Well, some of the
cells were cancerous.
</p><p>
And I just looked at her.
I said, What are you telling
me? Are you telling me I have
breast cancer? And she said,
Yeah. And I just, I mean, it
was amazing. It was like my
whole world just stopped.
It just stopped cold. Like
I couldn't hear anything. I
couldn't hear the people talking. I just went, oh my God.
</p><p>
Because cancer, you know.
Cancer equals death. A lot of
people get cancer and die.
And the idea of getting it is
just terrifying. There are a lot
of women who make it, but
there are a lot of women out
there and a lot of men who
don't make it. And it's not
just breast cancer. It's all
different types of cancer. So,
after she told me, I had to go
get dressed and I walked out
into the hall and the nurse
who had the facelift came up
to me, and she said, So,
you're Okay. You're all right.
Everything's good, right? And
I looked at her and I said, No.
No. It's not good. Her face
went completely down.
</p><p>
And I said, "Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry."
</p><p>
That was the beginning of
the apologies. I apologized to
everybody. I apologized to my
husband. I apologized to people at work. I apologized to
my friends because I thought
it was me, was my fault.
</p><p>
I must have done something
wrong. I must have not
taken enough care of myself.
It was probably because I
smoked cigarettes. It might
be from lots of different sorts
of things. Maybe it was this
cleaner that I had used on
the rug. But it had to be my
fault. It took me a long, long
time to realize that it was
nothing that I did. And I know
it's not my fault.

I was curious why the other
women in the support group
thought they got cancer.
Libby said that she got cancer
because she was exercising
on the floor and the dog
stepped on her breast. Is that
ludicrous? Well, who knows?
</p><p>
My friend Ann Marie Bronski
from my support group said
the reason she thinks she got
cancer is because she wore
miniskirts, no bra and a lot
of white lipstick in the '60s and
'70s.
</p><p>
The point being that nobody
knows. They just don't know.
Every single woman who I
know who has cancer would
give anything to know why.
</p><p>
Breast cancer brings you
into a whole new world. The
hardest thing I ever did during
that whole period of time
was walking into an office with
the word "oncology" over the
door. I just started shaking.
I just said oh, my God.
</p><p>
After the doctor had told me
that I indeed had breast cancer, she then told me that the
lump was small, but the cells
were a bit too aggressive,
which was bad. I was going to
need chemotherapy.
</p><p>
So, I said oh, bring on the
chemo. This is great. I'm
going to fight the good fight.
This is wonderful.
</p><p>
Then I started thinking about
it and I said, chemotherapy,
chemotherapy. So I called her
back and said, are you talking
about the chemotherapy that
makes you lose all of your hair
or the chemotherapy that
doesn't make you lose all your
hair? She said, well, that's
going to be up to your oncologist. And I said, okay.
</p><p>
Anyway, at Dana Farber, they
have these multidisciplinary
groups where the whole team
meets you, the breast surgeon,
the oncologist and the radiation doctor. Oncologists are
funny people. Actually, Hal
Berstein, when I first met him,
I asked him why do you do
this? Why do you do oncology?
He said it's fun, and I almost
slugged him. I said what do
you mean it's fun? This is fun?
This is not fun at all. But after
some time, I realized what he
meant is that it's really fun
when it works.
</p><p>
There were a lot of people who
were really trying to calm me
down. At one point, somebody
said, you should go to a support group.
</p><p>
I said I'm not into groups. I've
never done a group.
They said "You should go."
I found out through a friend,
Jay Hutchinson, who called a
friend of hers, that there was
this woman everyone called
Hester, the good. She was
Hester Hill at Beth Israel
Hospital Cancer Institute.
So, I called up Hester and
said I was headed toward
chemotherapy on December
10, 1997. She said come to
the group.
</p><p>
So, that was a very hard door
to walk through. I was going
as slow as I could down the
hall because I said I don't
want to do this. I don't want
to have to talk about it. I'm
going to cry. This is going to
be like the worst thing in the
world. I walked in, I sat down,
and I was just sitting there.
There were about five or six
other people and there was
Hester. In walks this woman.
She was very corporate. She
was very, what do you call it,
just very tailored-looking and
very pretty and just, anyway,
she sat down, she looked at
everybody and then she started
crying and said, "Why me?"
And I just looked at her and
said, oh, my God. She's crying.
I'm going to start crying. So I
started crying.
</p><p>
That woman was Libby.
She was my chemo buddy. We
went through chemotherapy
together. We didn't do it at the
same places---she did hers at
Beth Israel, and I was over at
the Dana Farber. But we talked
almost every single day on the
phone. She was my lifesaver.
</p><p>
Talking every day on the phone
to her, it was like, oh, how do
you feel today? Oh, well, I'm
feeling a little bad, or what's
going on today, or today's a
better day, and I'd say oh,
that's good and today was a
better day and if I have a bad
day, she'd say wait a day. It
was always like we were in
tune. One was always stronger
than the other and we could
help each other. We were just
incredible together.

<p>
We lost all of our hair. We
started talking a lot about it
every day and we'd give each
other support. And every day
we'd go outside wearing our
wigs or wearing hats or wearing a turban.
</p><p>
It's really interesting, when
you lose your hair and you're
fighting cancer, because everybody talks about
fighting cancer. You've got to fight cancer.
And it's okay, well, I'm going to
fight cancer and I'm going to
fight the good fight. And you
go outside into public wearing
a turban and walk into a bakery shop and, all of a sudden,
people turn around and go,
cancer has walked in the door.
</p><p>
People were terrified of me. I
used to go running home and
call Libby and say what's going
on? You mean I'm not going
to get any support for this? We
couldn't figure it out, so we got
really, really angry. We said
okay, forget about the wigs.
We're not going to wear the
wigs anymore, we're just going
to wear scarves. People are
going to see that we're bald.
</p><p>
Actually, we never had enough
gumption to go out in public
completely bald. We never
could do it. It was too scary.
Some women can do it. The
ones that can, I just think
they're amazing, that they can
do that.
</p><p>
Carol was one of those women
who could go out in public
bald. She was incredible.
I met Carol at a conference for
cancer, right after I had my
operation, and my doctors
were up on stage and they were
talking. It was during a question-and-answer period. Carol
got up there and asked why do
I have to have a mastectomy?
Why haven't you guys got the
research done? Why did I get
breast cancer? You guys aren't
doing your job.
</p><p>
I went, whoa! Who is this
woman? She asked what about
alternative medicine? Why
can't you use that? They were
trying to answer her questions
and stuff, and I said this
woman is really interesting.
So I went up to her after the
conference was over and I
said, my name is Debbie
Dorsey, I'd love to talk to you.
She lives on the Cape and I
live in the Boston area. We
started this long-distance telephone
relationship. She's fabulous.
She has so much spirit
and gumption and life in her.
</p><p>
People think of cancer, I call
it the cancer equation: cancer
equals death or cancer can
equal life. Getting a life-threatening disease and thinking
that you're going to die all of a
sudden makes you really, really
appreciate life more and how
important it really is and how
you should really cherish each
and every day. I still think
there are jerks in the world,
there are still lots of people
I don't like, but it doesn't
bother me as much in that
sort of situation.
</p><p>
Before my hair fell out, I was
very, very sad. I remember, one
day, sitting on the couch and
crying, sobbing. I had beautiful
long, beautiful brown auburn
hair. It was gorgeous. I don't
think it was really auburn,
maybe it was just dark, but
anyway, it was gorgeous. There
was just a lot of thick hair. It
was wonderful and it was, like,
my crowning glory.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I was sitting on the
couch and I was just sobbing.
And my son Bobby walked in.
He said, "Mom, why are you
crying?" We were very open
with Bobby, told him everything
right from the start so he knew
that I had cancer and stuff.
And he said "Mom, why are
you crying?" and I said I'm so
sad. I'm going to lose all my
hair. Your mother's going to be
bald. It's going to be awful. He
looked at me and he said
"Mom, isn't it better going
bald than dying?" And I just
looked at him like excuse me?
How old are you? He was
eight. And he just snapped me
out of it. Oh, well, I guess
you're right.
</p><p>
On December 10th, 1997 I
had my first treatment of
chemotherapy. Hal Bernstein
and Eric Weiner said, you're
going to get through this. And
I said, great. I said, so what's
the deal about the hair? And
they said, oh, fifteen days. I
said what do you mean? Oh,
yeah, it'll be out in fifteen days.
And I said yeah, I mean, but
there is a percentage of people
that aren't going to lose their
hair. They said yeah, but that's
very small. And I said well,
maybe I'll be one of those, and
he said fifteen days. So I went
home and started tugging at
my hair. Every day I would tug
at my hair. I would tug and tug
and tug and it wouldn't come
out. Then, Christmas morning,
Christmas morning I was sitting
there. I remember I was
sitting in the chair, we were
exchanging gifts and, all of a
sudden, I went tug, tug and
about seven strands came out.
I just looked at them and I
said well, maybe I'll be one of
the ones that it doesn't all fall
out. Anyway, before New Years,
Bob Burns and Bobbie buzzed
my head. I couldn't believe
it. I just couldn't believe it.
I couldn't believe it when I
looked at myself in the mirror
and I said oh, my God. That's
not me.
</p><p>
The worst part about it was
that I had a pointed head.
Some women have these beautiful
heads, but I had to have
a pointed head. I had a big,
pointed head and so I wasn't
too crazy about it. I just
remember every single day
waking up and looking at
myself in the mirror and going
oh, my God.
</p><p>
When I finished my treatment,
a doctor spoke with me and I
said what do I do now? Do
I exercise or diet? How do I
build up my immune system?
What should I do? Tell me
what I can do so that I don't
have to go through this again.
He said he didn't know. He
said the best thing you can do,
and he said I know it sounds
hard, but the best thing you
can do is pretend it never
happened. I said, excuse me?
Pretend it never happened?
Two surgeries, four doses of
chemotherapy and thirty-two
days of radiation and it never
happened to me? Yeah.
