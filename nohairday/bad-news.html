<p>Dearest Elsa,<br/> Have you heard about Carol. Her cancer has
metastasized to her lungs and her brain. She has difficulty breathing
and uses oxygen.  The docs are changing the chemo in the hopes they
can arrest it, but it will take several weeks before they know if the
new chemo is working or not. It's so scarey.</p>

<p>Terry's sister was in the 2nd building of the WTC in NYC on
September 11th and didn't make it out.  Carol is not doing very well.
She has cancer all over her chest wall, in her lungs and in her brain.
She's on oxygen. They're trying lots of different chemo. She's
exhausted. Not good, not good at all. Let's talk soon -Debbie</p>

<p>Hi Elsa. Carol is doing very badly. I haven't talked to her, but
did speak with her niece last night. Hospice is coming in sometime
later this week. So, that's all I know right now. I'll let you know as
I learn more- Take good care -Debbie D.</p>

<p>Dearest Elsa, I wanted to update you on Carol. She was in Italy for
the month of July with friends, and while she was there, the cancer
began to spread. When she returned in August and saw her oncologist,
the cancer had spread to her lungs and her brain.  Chemotherapy has
not done anything, and her body is full of the disease. She made the
decision not to have any further treatments.  She's at her home at the
cape and her friends are with her round the clock. Don't know if
she'll still be around by the 19th. I thought you'd want to know what
was happening. Cancer sucks! Feeling very sad, angry, guilty, and
scared all at the same time. Love. Libby.</p>

<p>I got your e-mail about including Carol's dying in your book. I've
thought a lot about it. I understand that you want to make the point
that this is real life, that people die and it seems that a lot people
we know have died lately.  After Carol died my immediate reaction was
to dedicate NoHairDay to Carol. Bob was the one who got me
thinking. He said NoHairDay is about life not death. I started
thinking that he was right. Here we were, three bald women having
poisons pumped into our body so that we wouldn't die of cancer romping
around in your studio making art and celebrating that we were alive.
I feel that readers will think what's the point? One of them died and
the others will probably die too. You have to keep the book full of
life. The photographs you took give hope to a lot of women who have
breast cancer. To read your book and to learn that Carol died will
only make them feel that breast cancer is a death sentence. And
sometimes it is but sometimes it's not. And we need to give those
women going through diagnosis and treatment the hope that they have a
good shot of making it. NoHairDay is about faith, hope friendship and
courage. There should be no obituaries.</p>

<p>It's not the way we hoped it would turn out; but we were each told
the same thing by our docs: there's no cure for breast cancer; there
are no guarantees that the disease will not return; it can return in 1
year, or in 5 years on in 10 years or in 18 years; or it may never
return. It's a crap shoot.  Debbie and I have learned that we can't
live our lives waiting for the cancer to return. If we do, then we are
the losers and the cancer has won. So, we live hoping that we will be
lucky and that the cancer won't return. Carol shared that hope and it
was especially evident when we were in your studio being photographed.
Without hope the cancer wins.</p>

Subject: Carol</pre>

<p>I get it luvs. But I think we have to add that Carol has died.
Photography is all abt death and I think abt death all the time.
Nothing stays the same as it was the moment it was photographed.
Photography taunts death, but of course the photograph decays and
so death wins. It was my dark soul that propelled me to make you
all so full of life. And the picture-making was my homage to the
people who had come to my studio in the same spirit you did and
who had died too soon. All the details of my photo sessions with
them were with me. I couldn't tell the three of you that I was
worried for you.</p>

<p>I can see skipping our heartbreaking news. But is nohairday only
uplifting or encouraging and funny? Nohairday is abt real life.
And Carol was the real thing. And the real thing happened to her.
Everyone who sees nohairday or reads our book can take it. One
thing I wish is that Carol's docs cd have said, hey yr cancer is so
virulent, forget treatments, enjoy life. Then Carol wdn't have had
to put up w/so much shit for as long as she did. WHY DON' T
THOSE DOCS KNOW MORE?</p>
